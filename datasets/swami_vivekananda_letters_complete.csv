<p>DEAR PANDITJI MAHÂRÂJ, (Pandit Shankarlal of Khetri.) </p>
<p>Your letter has reached me duly. I do not know why I should be
undeservingly praised. ""None is good, save One, that is, God"", as the
Lord Jesus hath said. The rest are only tools in His hands. ""Gloria in
Excelsis"", ""Glory unto God in the highest"", and unto men that deserve,
but not to such an undeserving one like me. Here ""the servant is <i>not</i>
worthy of the hire""; and a Fakir, especially, has no right to any
praise whatsoever, for would you praise your servant for simply doing
his duty? </p>
<p>. . . My unbounded gratitude to Pandit Sundarlalji, and to my
Professor (With whom he read the Mahâ-Bhâshya on Pânini.) for this kind
remembrance of me. </p>
<p>Now I would tell you something else. The Hindu mind was ever
deductive and never synthetic or inductive. In all our philosophies, we
always find hair-splitting arguments, taking for granted some general
proposition, but the proposition itself may be as childish as possible.
Nobody ever asked or searched the truth of these general propositions.
Therefore independent thought we have almost none to speak of, and
hence the dearth of those sciences which are the results of observation
and generalization. And why was it thus? &#8212; From two causes: The
tremendous heat of the climate forcing us to love rest and
contemplation better than activity, and the Brâhmins as priests never
undertaking journeys or voyages to distant lands. There were voyagers
and people who travelled far; but they were almost always traders, i.e.
people from whom priestcraft and their own sole love for gain had taken
away all capacity for intellectual development. So their observations,
instead of adding to the store of human knowledge, rather degenerated
it; for their<!--'Volume 5 Page 5'--> observations were
bad and their accounts exaggerated and tortured into fantastical
shapes, until they passed all recognition. </p>
<p>So you see, we must travel, we must go to foreign parts. We
must see how the engine of society works in other countries, and keep
free and open communication with what is going on in the minds of other
nations, if we really want to be a nation again. And over and above
all, we must cease to tyrannise. To what a ludicrous state are we
brought! If a Bhângi comes to anybody as a Bhangi, he would be shunned
as the plague; but no sooner does he get a cupful of water poured upon
his head with some mutterings of prayers by a Pâdri, and get a coat on
his back, no matter how threadbare, and come into the room of the most
orthodox Hindu &#8212; I don't see the man who then dare refuse him a chair
and a hearty shake of the hands! Irony can go no further. And come and
see what they, the Pâdris, are doing here in the Dakshin (south). They
are converting the lower classes by lakhs; and in Travancore, the most
priestridden country in India &#8212; where every bit of land is owned by the
Brahmins . . . nearly one-fourth has become Christian! And I cannot
blame them; what part have they in David and what in Jesse? When, when,
O Lords shall man be brother to man?</p>

<p class=""right"">ORIENTAL HOTEL <br>
YOKOHAMA. <br>
<i>10th July, 1893</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, BALAJI, G. G., BANKING CORPORATION, AND ALL MY
MADRAS FRIENDS, </p>
<p>Excuse my not keeping you constantly informed of my movements.
One is so busy every day, and especially<!--'Volume 5 Page 6'-->
myself who am quite new to the life of possessing things and taking
care of them. That consumes so much of my energy. It is really an awful
botheration. </p>
<p>From Bombay we reached Colombo. Our steamer remained in port
for nearly the whole day, and we took the opportunity of getting off to
have a look at the town. We drove through the streets, and the only
thing I remember was a temple in which was a very gigantic Murti
(image) of the Lord Buddha in a reclining posture, entering Nirvâna....
</p>
<p>The next station was Penang, which is only a strip of land
along the sea in the body of the Malaya Peninsula. The Malayas are all
Mohammedans and in old days were noted pirates and quite a dread to
merchantmen. But now the leviathan guns of modern turreted battleships
have forced the Malayas to look about for more peaceful pursuits. On
our way from Penang to Singapore, we had glimpses of Sumatra with its
high mountains, and the Captain pointed out to me several places as the
favourite haunts of pirates in days gone by. Singapore is the capital
of the Straits Settlements. It has a fine botanical garden with the
most splendid collection of palms. The beautiful fan-like palm, called
the traveller's palm, grows here in abundance, and the bread-fruit tree
everywhere. The celebrated mangosteen is as plentiful here as mangoes
in Madras, but mango is nonpareil. The people here are not half so dark
as the people of Madras, although so near the line. Singapore possesses
a fine museum too. </p>
<p>Hong Kong next. You feel that you have reached China, the
Chinese element predominates so much. All labour, all trade seems to be
in their hands. And Hong Kong is real China. As soon as the steamer
casts anchor, you are besieged with hundreds of Chinese boats to carry
you to the land. These boats with two helms are rather peculiar. The
boatman lives in the boat with his family. Almost always, the wife is
at the helms, managing<!--'Volume 5 Page 7'--> one with
her hands and the other with one of her feet. And in ninety per cent of
cases, you find a baby tied to her back, with the hands and feet of the
little Chin left free. It is a quaint sight to see the little John
Chinaman dangling very quietly from his mother's back, whilst she is
now setting with might and main, now pushing heavy loads, or jumping
with wonderful agility from boat to boat. And there is such a rush of
boats and steamlaunches coming in and going out. Baby John is every
moment put into the risk of having his little head pulverised, pigtail
and all; but he does not care a fig. This busy life seems to have no
charm for him, and he is quite content to learn the anatomy of a bit of
rice-cake given to him from time to time by the madly busy mother. The
Chinese child is quite a philosopher and calmly goes to work at an age
when your Indian boy can hardly crawl on all fours. He has learnt the
philosophy of necessity too well. Their extreme poverty is one of the
causes why the Chinese and the Indians have remained in a state of
mummified civilisation. To an ordinary Hindu or Chinese, everyday
necessity is too hideous to allow him to think of anything else. </p>
<p>Hong Kong is a very beautiful town. It is built on the slopes
of hills and on the tops too, which are much cooler than the city.
There is an almost perpendicular tramway going to the top of the hill,
dragged by wire-rope and steam-power. </p>
<p>We remained three days at Hong Kong and went to see Canton,
which is eighty miles up a river. The river is broad enough to allow
the biggest steamers to pass through. A number of Chinese steamers ply
between Hong Kong and Canton. We took passage on one of these in the
evening and reached Canton early in the morning. What a scene of bustle
and life! What an immense number of boats almost covering the waters!
And not only those that are carrying on the trade, but<!--'Volume 5 Page 8'-->
hundreds of others which serve as houses to live in. And quite a lot of
them so nice and big! In fact, they are big houses two or three storeys
high, with verandahs running round and streets between, and all
floating! </p>
<p>We landed on a strip of ground given by the Chinese Government
to foreigners to live in. Around us on both sides of the river for
miles and miles is the big city &#8212; a wilderness of human beings,
pushing, struggling, surging, roaring. But with all its population, all
its activity, it is the dirtiest town I saw, not in the sense in which
a town is called dirty in India, for as to that not a speck of filth is
allowed by the Chinese to go waste; but because of the Chinaman, who
has, it seems, taken a vow never to bathe! Every house is a shop,
people living only on the top floor. The streets are very very narrow,
so that you almost touch the shops on both sides as you pass. At every
ten paces you find meat-stalls, and there are shops which sell cat's
and dog's meat. Of course, only the poorest classes of Chinamen eat dog
or cat. </p>
<p>The Chinese ladies can never be seen. They have got as strict
a zenana as the Hindus of Northern India; only the women of the
labouring classes can be seen. Even amongst these, one sees now and
then a woman with feet smaller than those of your youngest child, and
of course they cannot be said to walk, but hobble. </p>
<p>I went to see several Chinese temples. The biggest in Canton
is dedicated to the memory of the first Buddhistic Emperor and the five
hundred first disciples of Buddhism. The central figure is of course
Buddha, and next beneath Him is seated the Emperor, and ranging on both
sides are the statues of the disciples, all beautifully carved out of
wood. </p>
<p>From Canton I returned back to Hong Kong, and from thence to
Japan. The first port we touched was Nagasaki. We landed for a few
hours and drove through the town. What a contrast! The Japanese are one
of the<!--'Volume 5 Page 9'--> cleanliest peoples on
earth. Everything is neat and tidy. Their streets are nearly all broad,
straight, and regularly paved. Their little houses are cage-like, and
their pine-covered evergreen little hills form the background of almost
every town and village. The short-statured, fair-skinned,
quaintly-dressed Japs, their movements, attitudes, gestures, everything
is picturesque. Japan is the land of the picturesque! Almost every
house has a garden at the back, very nicely laid out according to
Japanese fashion with small shrubs, grass-plots, small artificial
waters, and small stone bridges. </p>
<p>From Nagasaki to Kobe. Here I gave up the steamer and took the
land-route to Yokohama, with a view to see the interior of Japan. </p>
<p>I have seen three big cities in the interior &#8212; Osaka, a great
manufacturing town, Kyoto, the former capital, and Tokyo, the present
capital. Tokyo is nearly twice the size of Calcutta with nearly double
the population. </p>
<p>No foreigner is allowed to travel in the interior without a
passport. </p>
<p>The Japanese seem now to have fully awakened themselves to the
necessity of the present times. They have now a thoroughly organised
army equipped with guns which one of their own officers has invented
and which is said to be second to none. Then, they are continually
increasing their navy. I have seen a tunnel nearly a mile long, bored
by a Japanese engineer. </p>
<p>The match factories are simply a sight to see, and they are
bent upon making everything they want in their own country. There is a
Japanese line of steamers plying between China and Japan, which shortly
intends running between Bombay and Yokohama. </p>
<p>I saw quite a lot of temples. In every temple there are some
Sanskrit Mantras written in Old Bengali characters. Only a few of the
priests know Sanskrit. But they are an intelligent sect. The modern
rage for progress<!--'Volume 5 Page 10'--> has penetrated
even the priesthood. I cannot write what I have in my mind about the
Japs in one short letter. Only I want that numbers of our young men
should pay a visit to Japan and China every year. Especially to the
Japanese, India is still the dreamland of everything high and good. And
you, what are you? . . . talking twaddle all your lives, vain talkers,
what are you? Come, see these people, and then go and hide your faces
in shame. A race of dotards, you lose your caste if you come out!
Sitting down these hundreds of years with an ever-increasing load of
crystallised superstition on your heads, for hundreds of years spending
all your energy upon discussing the touchableness or untouchableness of
this food or that, with all humanity crushed out of you by the
continuous social tyranny of ages &#8212; what are you? And what are you
doing now? . . . promenading the sea-shores with books in your hands &#8212;
repeating undigested stray bits of European brainwork, and the whole
soul bent upon getting a thirty-rupee clerkship, or at best becoming a
lawyer &#8212; the height of young India's ambition &#8212; and every student with
a whole brood of hungry children cackling at his heels and asking for
bread! Is there not water enough in the sea to drown you, books, gowns,
university diplomas, and all? </p>
<p>Come, be men! Kick out the priests who are always against
progress, because they would never mend, their hearts would never
become big. They are the offspring of centuries of superstition and
tyranny. Root out priest craft first. Come, be men! Come out of your
narrow holes and have a look abroad. See how nations are on the march!
Do you love man? Do you love your country? Then come, let us struggle
for higher and better things; look not back, no, not even if you see
the dearest and nearest cry. Look not back, but forward! </p>
<p>India wants the sacrifice of at least a thousand or her young
men &#8212; men, mind, and not brutes. The English<!--'Volume 5 Page 11'-->
Government has been the instrument, brought over here by the Lord, to
break your crystallised civilisation, and Madras supplied the first men
who helped in giving the English a footing. How many men, unselfish,
thorough-going men, is Madras ready now to supply, to struggle unto
life and death to bring about a new state of things sympathy for the
poor, and bread to their hungry mouths, enlightenment to the people at
large &#8212; and struggle unto death to make men of them who have been
brought to the level of beasts, by the tyranny of your
forefathers?&nbsp; </p>

Baby John is every moment put into the risk of having his little head pulverised, pigtail and all; but he does not care a fig. This busy life seems to have no charm for him, and he is quite content to learn the anatomy of a bit of rice-cake given to him from time to time by the madly busy mother. The Chinese child is quite a philosopher and calmly goes to work at an age when your Indian boy can hardly crawl on all fours. He has learnt the philosophy of necessity too well. Their extreme poverty is one of the causes why the Chinese and the Indians have remained in a state of mummified civilisation. To an ordinary Hindu or Chinese, everyday necessity is too hideous to allow him to think of anything else.

Hong Kong is a very beautiful town. It is built on the slopes of hills and on the tops too, which are much cooler than the city. There is an almost perpendicular tramway going to the top of the hill, dragged by wire-rope and steam-power.

We remained three days at Hong Kong and went to see Canton, which is eighty miles up a river. The river is broad enough to allow the biggest steamers to pass through. A number of Chinese steamers ply between Hong Kong and Canton. We took passage on one of these in the evening and reached Canton early in the morning. What a scene of bustle and life! What an immense number of boats almost covering the waters! And not only those that are carrying on the trade, buthundreds of others which serve as houses to live in. And quite a lot of them so nice and big! In fact, they are big houses two or three storeys high, with verandahs running round and streets between, and all floating!

We landed on a strip of ground given by the Chinese Government to foreigners to live in. Around us on both sides of the river for miles and miles is the big city — a wilderness of human beings, pushing, struggling, surging, roaring. But with all its population, all its activity, it is the dirtiest town I saw, not in the sense in which a town is called dirty in India, for as to that not a speck of filth is allowed by the Chinese to go waste; but because of the Chinaman, who has, it seems, taken a vow never to bathe! Every house is a shop, people living only on the top floor. The streets are very very narrow, so that you almost touch the shops on both sides as you pass. At every ten paces you find meat-stalls, and there are shops which sell cat's and dog's meat. Of course, only the poorest classes of Chinamen eat dog or cat.

The Chinese ladies can never be seen. They have got as strict a zenana as the Hindus of Northern India; only the women of the labouring classes can be seen. Even amongst these, one sees now and then a woman with feet smaller than those of your youngest child, and of course they cannot be said to walk, but hobble.

I went to see several Chinese temples. The biggest in Canton is dedicated to the memory of the first Buddhistic Emperor and the five hundred first disciples of Buddhism. The central figure is of course Buddha, and next beneath Him is seated the Emperor, and ranging on both sides are the statues of the disciples, all beautifully carved out of wood.

From Canton I returned back to Hong Kong, and from thence to Japan. The first port we touched was Nagasaki. We landed for a few hours and drove through the town. What a contrast! The Japanese are one of thecleanliest peoples on earth. Everything is neat and tidy. Their streets are nearly all broad, straight, and regularly paved. Their little houses are cage-like, and their pine-covered evergreen little hills form the background of almost every town and village. The short-statured, fair-skinned, quaintly-dressed Japs, their movements, attitudes, gestures, everything is picturesque. Japan is the land of the picturesque! Almost every house has a garden at the back, very nicely laid out according to Japanese fashion with small shrubs, grass-plots, small artificial waters, and small stone bridges.

From Nagasaki to Kobe. Here I gave up the steamer and took the land-route to Yokohama, with a view to see the interior of Japan.

I have seen three big cities in the interior — Osaka, a great manufacturing town, Kyoto, the former capital, and Tokyo, the present capital. Tokyo is nearly twice the size of Calcutta with nearly double the population.

No foreigner is allowed to travel in the interior without a passport.

The Japanese seem now to have fully awakened themselves to the necessity of the present times. They have now a thoroughly organised army equipped with guns which one of their own officers has invented and which is said to be second to none. Then, they are continually increasing their navy. I have seen a tunnel nearly a mile long, bored by a Japanese engineer.

The match factories are simply a sight to see, and they are bent upon making everything they want in their own country. There is a Japanese line of steamers plying between China and Japan, which shortly intends running between Bombay and Yokohama.

I saw quite a lot of temples. In every temple there are some Sanskrit Mantras written in Old Bengali characters. Only a few of the priests know Sanskrit. But they are an intelligent sect. The modern rage for progresshas penetrated even the priesthood. I cannot write what I have in my mind about the Japs in one short letter. Only I want that numbers of our young men should pay a visit to Japan and China every year. Especially to the Japanese, India is still the dreamland of everything high and good. And you, what are you? . . . talking twaddle all your lives, vain talkers, what are you? Come, see these people, and then go and hide your faces in shame. A race of dotards, you lose your caste if you come out! Sitting down these hundreds of years with an ever-increasing load of crystallised superstition on your heads, for hundreds of years spending all your energy upon discussing the touchableness or untouchableness of this food or that, with all humanity crushed out of you by the continuous social tyranny of ages — what are you? And what are you doing now? . . . promenading the sea-shores with books in your hands — repeating undigested stray bits of European brainwork, and the whole soul bent upon getting a thirty-rupee clerkship, or at best becoming a lawyer — the height of young India's ambition — and every student with a whole brood of hungry children cackling at his heels and asking for bread! Is there not water enough in the sea to drown you, books, gowns, university diplomas, and all?

Come, be men! Kick out the priests who are always against progress, because they would never mend, their hearts would never become big. They are the offspring of centuries of superstition and tyranny. Root out priest craft first. Come, be men! Come out of your narrow holes and have a look abroad. See how nations are on the march! Do you love man? Do you love your country? Then come, let us struggle for higher and better things; look not back, no, not even if you see the dearest and nearest cry. Look not back, but forward!

India wants the sacrifice of at least a thousand or her young men — men, mind, and not brutes. The EnglishGovernment has been the instrument, brought over here by the Lord, to break your crystallised civilisation, and Madras supplied the first men who helped in giving the English a footing. How many men, unselfish, thorough-going men, is Madras ready now to supply, to struggle unto life and death to bring about a new state of things sympathy for the poor, and bread to their hungry mouths, enlightenment to the people at large — and struggle unto death to make men of them who have been brought to the level of beasts, by the tyranny of your forefathers?

PS. Calm and silent and steady work, and no newspaper humbug, no name-making, you must always remember.",V.,,1864,1,0

<p class=""right"">BREEZY MEADOWS, <br>
METCALF, MASS., <br>
<i>20th August, 1893</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>Received your letter yesterday. Perhaps you have by this time
got my letter from Japan. From Japan I reached Vancouver. The way was
by the Northern Pacific. It was very cold and I suffered much for want
of warm clothing. However, I reached Vancouver anyhow, and thence went
through Canada to Chicago. I remained about twelve days in Chicago. And
almost every day I used to go to the Fair. It is a tremendous affair.
One must take at least ten days to go through it. The lady to whom
Varada Rao introduced me and her<!--'Volume 5 Page 12'-->
husband belong to the highest Chicago society, and they were so very
kind to me. I took my departure from Chicago and came to Boston. Mr.
Lâlubhâi was with me up to Boston. He was very kind to me. . . . </p>
<p>The expense I am bound to run into here is awful. You
remember, you gave me £170 in notes and £9 in cash. It has come down to
£130 in all!! On an average it costs me £1 every day; a cigar costs
eight annas of our money. The Americans are so rich that they spend
money like water, and by forced legislation keep up the price of
everything so high that no other nation on earth can approach it. Every
common coolie earns nine or ten rupees a day and spends as much. All
those rosy ideas we had before starting have melted, and I have now to
fight against impossibilities. A hundred times I had a mind to go out
of the country and go back to India. But I am determined, and I have a
call from Above; I see no way, but His eyes see. And I must stick to my
guns, life or death. . . . </p>
<p>Just now I am living as the guest of an old lady in a village
near Boston. I accidentally made her acquaintance in the railway train,
and she invited me to come over and live with her. I have an advantage
in living with her, in saving for some time my expenditure of £1 per
day, and she has the advantage of inviting her friends over here and
showing them a curio from India! And all this must be borne.
Starvation, cold, hooting in the streets on account of my quaint dress,
these are what I have to fight against. But, my dear boy, no great
things were ever done without great labour. </p>
<p>. . .&nbsp; Know, then, that this is the land of
Christians, and any other influence than that is almost zero. Nor do I
care a bit for the enmity of any &#8212; ists in the world. I am here amongst
the children of the Son of Mary and the Lord Jesus will help me. They
like much the broad views of Hinduism and my love for the Prophet of<!--'Volume 5 Page 13'-->
Nazareth. I tell them that I preach nothing against the Great One of
Galilee. I only ask the Christians to take in the Great Ones of Ind
along with the Lord Jesus, and they appreciate it. </p>
<p>Winter is approaching and I shall have to get all sorts of
warm clothing, and we require more warm clothing than the natives. . .
Look sharp, my boy, take courage. We are destined by the Lord to do
great things in India. Have faith. We will do. We, the poor and the
despised, who really feel, and not those. . . . </p>
<p>In Chicago, the other day, a funny thing happened The Raja of
Kapurthala was here, and he was being lionised by some portion of
Chicago society. I once met the Raja in the Fair grounds, but he was
too big to speak with a poor Fakir. There was an eccentric Mahratta
Brâhmin selling nail-made pictures in the Fair, dressed in a dhoti.
This fellow told the reporters all sorts of things against the Raja &#8212;,
that he was a man of low caste, that those Rajas were nothing but
slaves, and that they generally led immoral lives, etc., etc. And these
truthful (?) editors, for which America is famous, wanted to give to
the boy's stories some weight; and so the next day they wrote huge
columns in their papers about the description of a man of wisdom from
India, meaning me &#8212; extolling me to the skies, and putting all sorts of
words in my mouth, which I never even dreamt of, and ascribing to me
all those remarks made by the Mahratta Brahmin about the Raja of
Kapurthala. And it was such a good brushing that Chicago society gave
up the Raja in hot haste. . . . These newspaper editors made capital
out of me to give my countryman a brushing. That shows, however, that
in this country intellect carries more weight than all the pomp of
money and title. </p>
<p>Yesterday Mrs. Johnson, the lady superintendent of the women's
prison, was here. They don't call it prison but reformatory here. It is
the grandest thing I have seen<!--'Volume 5 Page 14'--> in
America. How the inmates are benevolently treated, how they are
reformed and sent back as useful members of society; how grand, how
beautiful, You must see to believe! And, oh, how my heart ached to
think of what we think of the poor, the low, in India. They have no
chance, no escape, no way to climb up. The poor, the low, the sinner in
India have no friends, no help &#8212; they cannot rise, try however they
may. They sink lower and lower every day, they feel the blows showered
upon them by a cruel society, and they do not know whence the blow
comes. They have forgotten that they too are men. And the result is
slavery. Thoughtful people within the last few years have seen it, but
unfortunately laid it at the door of the Hindu religion, and to them,
the only way of bettering is by crushing this grandest religion of the
world. Hear me, my friend, I have discovered the secret through the
grace of the Lord. Religion is not in fault. On the other hand, your
religion teaches you that every being is only your own self multiplied.
But it was the want of practical application, the want of sympathy &#8212;
the want of heart. The Lord once more came to you as Buddha and taught
you how to feel, how to sympathise with the poor, the miserable, the
sinner, but you heard Him not. Your priests invented the horrible story
that the Lord was here for deluding demons with false doctrines! True
indeed, but we are the demons, not those that believed. And just as the
Jews denied the Lord Jesus and are since that day wandering over the
world as homeless beggars, tyrannised over by everybody, so you are
bond-slaves to any nation that thinks it worth while to rule over you.
Ah, tyrants! you do not know that the obverse is tyranny, and the
reverse slavery. The slave and the tyrant are synonymous. </p>
<p>Balaji and G. G. may remember one evening at Pondicherry &#8212; we
were discussing the matter of sea-voyage with a Pandit, and I shall
always remember his brutal<!--'Volume 5 Page 15'-->
gestures and his Kadâpi Na (never)! They do not know that India is a
very small part of the world, and the whole world looks down with
contempt upon the three hundred millions of earthworms crawling upon
the fair soil of India and trying to oppress each other. This state of
things must be removed, not by destroying religion but by following the
great teachings of the Hindu faith, and joining with it the wonderful
sympathy of that logical development of Hinduism &#8212; Buddhism. </p>
<p>A hundred thousand men and women, fired with the zeal of
holiness, fortified with eternal faith in the Lord, and nerved to
lion's courage by their sympathy for the poor and the fallen and the
downtrodden, will go over the length and breadth of the land, preaching
the gospel of salvation, the gospel of help, the gospel of social
raising-up &#8212; the gospel of equality. </p>
<p>No religion on earth preaches the dignity of humanity in such
a lofty strain as Hinduism, and no religion on earth treads upon the
necks of the poor and the low in such a fashion as Hinduism. The Lord
has shown me that religion is not in fault, but it is the Pharisees and
Sadducees in Hinduism, hypocrites, who invent all sorts of engines of
tyranny in the shape of doctrines of <br>
Pâramârthika and Vyâvahârika. </p>
<p>Despair not; remember the Lord says in the Gita, ""To work you
have the right, but not to the result."" Gird up your loins, my boy. I
am called by the Lord for this. I have been dragged through a whole
life full of crosses and tortures, I have seen the nearest and dearest
die, almost of starvation; I have been ridiculed, distrusted, and have
suffered for my sympathy for the very men who scoff and scorn. Well, my
boy, this is the school of misery, which is also the school for great
souls and prophets for the cultivation of sympathy, of patience, and,
above all, of an indomitable iron will which quakes not even if the
universe be pulverised<!--'Volume 5 Page 16'--> at our
feet. I pity them. It is not their fault. They are children, yea,
veritable children, though they be great and high in society. Their
eyes see nothing beyond their little horizon of a few yards &#8212; the
routine-work, eating, drinking, earning, and begetting, following each
other in mathematical precision. They know nothing beyond &#8212; happy
little souls! Their sleep is never disturbed, their nice little brown
studies of lives never rudely shocked by the wail of woe, of misery, of
degradation, and poverty, that has filled the Indian atmosphere &#8212; the
result of centuries of oppression. They little dream of the ages of
tyranny, mental, moral, and physical, that has reduced the image of God
to a mere beast of burden; the emblem of the Divine Mother, to a slave
to bear children; and life itself, a curse. But there are others who
see, feel, and shed tears of blood in their hearts, who think that
there is a remedy for it, and who are ready to apply this remedy at any
cost, even to the giving up of life. And ""of such is the kingdom of
Heaven"". Is it not then natural, my friends, that they have no time to
look down from their heights to the vagariese of these contemptible
little insects, ready every moment to spit their little venoms? </p>
<p>Trust not to the so-called rich, they are more dead than
alive. The hope lies in you &#8212; in the meek, the lowly, but the faithful.
Have faith in the Lord; no policy, it is nothing. Feel for the
miserable and look up for help &#8212; it <i>shall come</i>. I
have travelled twelve years with this load in my heart and this idea in
my head. I have gone from door to door of the so-called rich and great.
With a bleeding heart I have crossed half the world to this strange
land, seeking for help. The Lord is great. I know He will help me. I
may perish of cold or hunger in this land, but I bequeath to you, young
men, this sympathy, this struggle for the poor, the ignorant, the
oppressed. Go now this minute to the<!--'Volume 5 Page 17'-->
temple of Pârthasârathi, (Shri Krishna as Sârathi, charioteer, of
Pârtha or Arjuna.) and before Him who was friend to the poor and lowly
cowherds of Gokula, who never shrank to embrace the Pariah Guhaka, who
accepted the invitation of a prostitute in preference to that of the
nobles and saved her in His incarnation as Buddha &#8212; yea, down on your
faces before Him, and make a great sacrifice, the sacrifice of a whole
life for them, for whom He comes from time to time, whom He loves above
all, the poor, the lowly, the oppressed. Vow, then, to devote your
whole lives to the cause of the redemption of these three hundred
millions, going down and down every day. </p>
<p>It is not the work of a day, and the path is full of the most
deadly thorns. But Parthasarathi is ready to be our Sârathi &#8212; we know
that. And in His name and with eternal faith in Him, set fire to the
mountain of misery that has been heaped upon India for ages &#8212; and it
shall be burned down. Come then, look it in the face, brethren, it is a
grand task, and we are so low. But we are the sons of Light and
children of God. Glory unto the Lord, we will succeed. Hundreds will
fall in the struggle, hundreds will be ready to take it up. I may die
here unsuccessful, another will take up the task. You know the disease,
you know the remedy, only have faith. Do not look up to the so-called
rich and great; do not care for the heartless intellectual writers, and
their cold-blooded newspaper articles. Faith, sympathy &#8212; fiery faith
and fiery sympathy! Life is nothing, death is nothing, hunger nothing,
cold nothing. Glory unto the Lord &#8212; march on, the Lord is our General.
Do not look back to see who falls &#8212; forward &#8212; onward! Thus and thus we
shall go on, brethren. One falls, and another takes up the work. </p>
<p>From this village I am going to Boston tomorrow. I am going to
speak at a big Ladies' Club here, which is<!--'Volume 5 Page 18'-->
helping Ramâbâi. I must first go and buy some clothing in Boston. If I
am to live longer here, my quaint dress will not do. People gather by
hundreds in the streets to see me. So what I want is to dress myself in
a long black coat, and keep a red robe and turban to wear when I
lecture. This is what the ladies advise me to do, and they are the
rulers here, and I must have their sympathy. Before you get this letter
my money would come down to somewhat about £70 of £60. So try your best
to send some money. It is necessary to remain here for some time to
have any influence here. I could not see the phonograph for Mr.
Bhattacharya as I got his letter here. If I go to Chicago again, I will
look for them. I do not know whether I shall go back to Chicago or not.
My friends there write me to represent India. And the gentleman, to
whom Varada Rao introduced me, is one of the directors of the Fair; but
then I refused as I would have to spend all any little stock of money
in remaining more than a month in Chicago. </p>
<p>In America, there are no classes in the railway except in
Canada. So I have to travel first-class, as that is the only class; but
I do not venture in the Pullmans. They are very comfortable &#8212; you
sleep, eat, drink, even bathe in them, just as if you were in a hotel &#8212;
but they are too expensive. </p>
<p>It is very hard work getting into society and making yourself
heard. Now nobody is in the towns, they are all away in summer places.
They will all come back in winter. Therefore I must wait. After such a
struggle, I am not going to give up easily. Only try your best to help
me as much as you can; and even if you cannot, I must try to the end.
And even if I die of cold or disease or hunger here, you take up the
task. Holiness sincerity, and faith. I have left instructions with
Cooks to forward any letter or money to me wherever I am. Rome was not
built in a day. If you can keep me here<!--'Volume 5 Page 19'-->
for six months at least, I hope everything will come right. In the
meantime I am trying my best to find any plank I can float upon. And if
I find out any means to support myself, I shall wire to you
immediately. </p>
<p>First I will try in America; and if I fail, try in England; if
I fail, go back to India and wait for further commands from High.
Ramdas's father has gone to England. He is in a hurry to gone home. He
is a very good man at heart, only the Baniya roughness on the surface.
It would take more than twenty days for the letter to reach. Even now
it is so cold in New England that every day we have fires night and
morning. Canada is still colder. I never saw snow on such low hills as
there. </p>
<p>Gradually I can make my way; but that means a longer residence
in this horribly expensive country. Just now the raising of the Rupee
in India has created a panic in this country, and lots of mills have
been stopped. So I cannot hope for anything just now, but I must wait. </p>
<p>Just now I have been to the tailor and ordered some winter
clothings, and that would cost at least Rs. 300 and up. And still it
would not be good clothes, only decent. Ladies here are very particular
about a man's dress, and they are the power in this country. They. . .
never fail the missionaries. They are helping our Ramabai every year.
If you fail in keeping me here, send some money to get me out of the
country. In the meantime if anything turns out in my favour, I will
write or wire. A word costs Rs. 4 in cable!! </p>

Your priests invented the horrible story that the Lord was here for deluding demons with false doctrines! True indeed, but we are the demons, not those that believed. And just as the Jews denied the Lord Jesus and are since that day wandering over the world as homeless beggars, tyrannised over by everybody, so you are bond-slaves to any nation that thinks it worth while to rule over you. Ah, tyrants! you do not know that the obverse is tyranny, and the reverse slavery. The slave and the tyrant are synonymous.

Balaji and G. G. may remember one evening at Pondicherry — we were discussing the matter of sea-voyage with a Pandit, and I shall always remember his brutalgestures and his Kadâpi Na (never)! They do not know that India is a very small part of the world, and the whole world looks down with contempt upon the three hundred millions of earthworms crawling upon the fair soil of India and trying to oppress each other. This state of things must be removed, not by destroying religion but by following the great teachings of the Hindu faith, and joining with it the wonderful sympathy of that logical development of Hinduism — Buddhism.

A hundred thousand men and women, fired with the zeal of holiness, fortified with eternal faith in the Lord, and nerved to lion's courage by their sympathy for the poor and the fallen and the downtrodden, will go over the length and breadth of the land, preaching the gospel of salvation, the gospel of help, the gospel of social raising-up — the gospel of equality.

No religion on earth preaches the dignity of humanity in such a lofty strain as Hinduism, and no religion on earth treads upon the necks of the poor and the low in such a fashion as Hinduism. The Lord has shown me that religion is not in fault, but it is the Pharisees and Sadducees in Hinduism, hypocrites, who invent all sorts of engines of tyranny in the shape of doctrines ofPâramârthika and Vyâvahârika.

Despair not; remember the Lord says in the Gita, ""To work you have the right, but not to the result."" Gird up your loins, my boy. I am called by the Lord for this. I have been dragged through a whole life full of crosses and tortures, I have seen the nearest and dearest die, almost of starvation; I have been ridiculed, distrusted, and have suffered for my sympathy for the very men who scoff and scorn. Well, my boy, this is the school of misery, which is also the school for great souls and prophets for the cultivation of sympathy, of patience, and, above all, of an indomitable iron will which quakes not even if the universe be pulverisedat our feet. I pity them. It is not their fault. They are children, yea, veritable children, though they be great and high in society. Their eyes see nothing beyond their little horizon of a few yards — the routine-work, eating, drinking, earning, and begetting, following each other in mathematical precision. They know nothing beyond — happy little souls! Their sleep is never disturbed, their nice little brown studies of lives never rudely shocked by the wail of woe, of misery, of degradation, and poverty, that has filled the Indian atmosphere — the result of centuries of oppression. They little dream of the ages of tyranny, mental, moral, and physical, that has reduced the image of God to a mere beast of burden; the emblem of the Divine Mother, to a slave to bear children; and life itself, a curse. But there are others who see, feel, and shed tears of blood in their hearts, who think that there is a remedy for it, and who are ready to apply this remedy at any cost, even to the giving up of life. And ""of such is the kingdom of Heaven"". Is it not then natural, my friends, that they have no time to look down from their heights to the vagariese of these contemptible little insects, ready every moment to spit their little venoms?

Trust not to the so-called rich, they are more dead than alive. The hope lies in you — in the meek, the lowly, but the faithful. Have faith in the Lord; no policy, it is nothing. Feel for the miserable and look up for help — itshall come. I have travelled twelve years with this load in my heart and this idea in my head. I have gone from door to door of the so-called rich and great. With a bleeding heart I have crossed half the world to this strange land, seeking for help. The Lord is great. I know He will help me. I may perish of cold or hunger in this land, but I bequeath to you, young men, this sympathy, this struggle for the poor, the ignorant, the oppressed. Go now this minute to thetemple of Pârthasârathi, (Shri Krishna as Sârathi, charioteer, of Pârtha or Arjuna.) and before Him who was friend to the poor and lowly cowherds of Gokula, who never shrank to embrace the Pariah Guhaka, who accepted the invitation of a prostitute in preference to that of the nobles and saved her in His incarnation as Buddha — yea, down on your faces before Him, and make a great sacrifice, the sacrifice of a whole life for them, for whom He comes from time to time, whom He loves above all, the poor, the lowly, the oppressed. Vow, then, to devote your whole lives to the cause of the redemption of these three hundred millions, going down and down every day.

It is not the work of a day, and the path is full of the most deadly thorns. But Parthasarathi is ready to be our Sârathi — we know that. And in His name and with eternal faith in Him, set fire to the mountain of misery that has been heaped upon India for ages — and it shall be burned down. Come then, look it in the face, brethren, it is a grand task, and we are so low. But we are the sons of Light and children of God. Glory unto the Lord, we will succeed. Hundreds will fall in the struggle, hundreds will be ready to take it up. I may die here unsuccessful, another will take up the task. You know the disease, you know the remedy, only have faith. Do not look up to the so-called rich and great; do not care for the heartless intellectual writers, and their cold-blooded newspaper articles. Faith, sympathy — fiery faith and fiery sympathy! Life is nothing, death is nothing, hunger nothing, cold nothing. Glory unto the Lord — march on, the Lord is our General. Do not look back to see who falls — forward — onward! Thus and thus we shall go on, brethren. One falls, and another takes up the work.

From this village I am going to Boston tomorrow. I am going to speak at a big Ladies' Club here, which ishelping Ramâbâi. I must first go and buy some clothing in Boston. If I am to live longer here, my quaint dress will not do. People gather by hundreds in the streets to see me. So what I want is to dress myself in a long black coat, and keep a red robe and turban to wear when I lecture. This is what the ladies advise me to do, and they are the rulers here, and I must have their sympathy. Before you get this letter my money would come down to somewhat about £70 of £60. So try your best to send some money. It is necessary to remain here for some time to have any influence here. I could not see the phonograph for Mr. Bhattacharya as I got his letter here. If I go to Chicago again, I will look for them. I do not know whether I shall go back to Chicago or not. My friends there write me to represent India. And the gentleman, to whom Varada Rao introduced me, is one of the directors of the Fair; but then I refused as I would have to spend all any little stock of money in remaining more than a month in Chicago.

In America, there are no classes in the railway except in Canada. So I have to travel first-class, as that is the only class; but I do not venture in the Pullmans. They are very comfortable — you sleep, eat, drink, even bathe in them, just as if you were in a hotel — but they are too expensive.

It is very hard work getting into society and making yourself heard. Now nobody is in the towns, they are all away in summer places. They will all come back in winter. Therefore I must wait. After such a struggle, I am not going to give up easily. Only try your best to help me as much as you can; and even if you cannot, I must try to the end. And even if I die of cold or disease or hunger here, you take up the task. Holiness sincerity, and faith. I have left instructions with Cooks to forward any letter or money to me wherever I am. Rome was not built in a day. If you can keep me herefor six months at least, I hope everything will come right. In the meantime I am trying my best to find any plank I can float upon. And if I find out any means to support myself, I shall wire to you immediately.

First I will try in America; and if I fail, try in England; if I fail, go back to India and wait for further commands from High. Ramdas's father has gone to England. He is in a hurry to gone home. He is a very good man at heart, only the Baniya roughness on the surface. It would take more than twenty days for the letter to reach. Even now it is so cold in New England that every day we have fires night and morning. Canada is still colder. I never saw snow on such low hills as there.

Gradually I can make my way; but that means a longer residence in this horribly expensive country. Just now the raising of the Rupee in India has created a panic in this country, and lots of mills have been stopped. So I cannot hope for anything just now, but I must wait.

Just now I have been to the tailor and ordered some winter clothings, and that would cost at least Rs. 300 and up. And still it would not be good clothes, only decent. Ladies here are very particular about a man's dress, and they are the power in this country. They. . . never fail the missionaries. They are helping our Ramabai every year. If you fail in keeping me here, send some money to get me out of the country. In the meantime if anything turns out in my favour, I will write or wire. A word costs Rs. 4 in cable!!","Yours,VIVEKANANDA.",,2947,1,0

<h2>V</h2>
<p class=""right"">CHICAGO, <br>
<i>2nd November, 1893</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I am so sorry that a moment's weakness on my part should cause
you so much trouble; I was out of pocket at<!--'Volume 5 Page 20'-->
that time. Since then the Lord sent me friends. At a village near
Boston I made the acquaintance of Dr. Wright, Professor of Greek in the
Harvard University. He sympathised with me very much and urged upon me
the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought
would give me an introduction to the nation. As I was not acquainted
with anybody, the Professor undertook to arrange everything for me, and
eventually I came back to Chicago. Here I, together with the oriental
and occidental delegates to the Parliament of Religions, were all
lodged in the house of a gentleman. </p>
<p>On the morning of the opening of the Parliament, we all
assembled in a building called the Art Palace, where one huge and other
smaller temporary halls were erected for the sittings of the
Parliament. Men from all nations were there. From India were Mazoomdar
of the Brâhmo Samâj, and Nagarkar of Bombay, Mr. Gandhi representing
the Jains, and Mr. Chakravarti representing Theosophy with Mrs. Annie
Besant. Of these, Mazoomdar and I were, of course, old friends, and
Chakravarti knew me by name. There was a grand procession, and we were
all marshalled on to the platform. Imagine a hall below and a huge
gallery above, packed with six or seven thousand men and women
representing the best culture of the country, and on the platform
learned men of all the nations of the earth. And I, who never spoke in
public in my life, to address this august assemblage!! It was opened in
great form with music and ceremony and speeches; then the delegates
were introduced one by one, and they stepped up and spoke. Of course my
heart was fluttering, and my tongue nearly dried up; I was so nervous
and could not venture to speak in the morning. Mazoomdar made a nice
speech, Chakravarti a nicer one, and they were much applauded. They
were all prepared and came with ready-made speeches. I was a fool and
had none, but bowed down to Devi Sarasvati<!--'Volume 5 Page 21'-->
and stepped up, and Dr. Barrows introduced me. I made a short speech. I
addressed the assembly as ""Sisters and Brothers of America"", a
deafening applause of two minutes followed, and then I proceeded; and
when it was finished, I sat down, almost exhausted with emotion. The
next day all the papers announced that my speech was the hit of the
day, and I became known to the whole of America. Truly has it been said
by the great commentator Shridhara &#8212; ""&#2350;&#2370;&#2325;&#2306; &#2325;&#2352;&#2379;&#2340;&#2367; &#2357;&#2366;&#2330;&#2366;&#2354;&#2306; &#8212; Who maketh
the dumb a
fluent speaker."" His name be praised! From that day I became a
celebrity, and the day I read my paper on Hinduism, the hall was packed
as it had never been before. I quote to you from one of the papers:
""Ladies, ladies, ladies packing every place &#8212; filling every corner,
they patiently waited and waited while the papers that separated them
from Vivekananda were read"", etc. You would be astonished if I sent
over to you the newspaper cuttings, but you already know that I am a
hater of celebrity. Suffice it to say, that whenever I went on the
platform, a deafening applause would be raised for me. Nearly all the
papers paid high tributes to me, and even the most bigoted had to admit
that ""This man with his handsome face and magnetic presence and
wonderful oratory is the most prominent figure in the Parliament"",
etc., etc. Sufficient for you to know that never before did an Oriental
make such an impression on American society. </p>
<p>And how to speak of their kindness? I have no more wants now,
I am well off, and all the money that I require to visit Europe I shall
get from here. . . . A boy called Narasimhâchârya has cropped up in our
midst. He has been loafing about the city for the last three years.
Loafing or no loafing, I like him; but please write to me all about him
if you know anything. He knows you. He came in the year of the Paris
Exhibition to Europe. . . . </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 22'-->
<p>I am now out of want. Many of the handsomest houses in this
city are open to me. All the time I am living as a guest of somebody or
other. There is a curiosity in this nation, such as you meet with
nowhere else. They want to know everything, and their women &#8212; they are
the most advanced in the world. The average American woman is far more
cultivated than the average American man. The men slave all their life
for money, and the women snatch every opportunity to improve
themselves. And they are a very kind-hearted, frank people. Everybody
who has a fad to preach comes here, and I am sorry to say that most of
these are not sound. The Americans have their faults too, and what
nation has not? But this is my summing up: Asia laid the germs of
civilization, Europe developed man, and America is developing the woman
and the masses. It is the paradise of the woman and the labourer. Now
contrast the American masses and women with ours, and you get the idea
at once. The Americans are fast becoming liberal. Judge them not by the
specimens of <i>hard-shelled Christians</i> (it is their
own phrase) that you see in India. There are those here too, but their
number is decreasing rapidly, and this great nation is progressing fast
towards that spirituality which is the standard boast of the Hindu. </p>
<p>The Hindu must not give up his religion, but must keep
religion within its proper limits end give freedom to society to grow.
All the reformers in India made the serious mistake of holding religion
accountable for all the horrors of priestcraft and degeneration and
went forth with to pull down the indestructible structure, and what was
the result? Failure! Beginning from Buddha down to Ram Mohan Roy,
everyone made the mistake of holding caste to be a religious
institution and tried to pull down religion and caste all together, and
failed. But in spite of all the ravings of the priests, caste is simply
a crystallised social institution, which after doing its service<!--'Volume 5 Page 23'-->
is now filling the atmosphere of India with its stench, and it can only
be removed by giving back to the people their lost social
individuality. Every man born here knows that he is a <i>man</i>.
Every man born in India knows that he is a slave of society. Now,
freedom is the only condition of growth; take that off, the result is
degeneration. With the introduction of modern competition, see how
caste is disappearing fast! No religion is now necessary to kill it.
The Brâhmana shopkeeper, shoemaker, and wine-distiller are common in
Northern India. And why? Because of competition. No man is prohibited
from doing anything he pleases for his livelihood under the present
Government, and the result is neck and neck competition, and thus
thousands are seeking and finding the highest level they were born for,
instead of vegetating at the bottom. </p>
<p>I must remain in this country at least through the winter, and
then go to Europe. The Lord will provide everything for me. You need
not disturb yourself about it. I cannot express my gratitude for your
love. </p>
<p>Day by day I am feeling that the Lord is with me, and I am
trying to follow His direction. His will be done. . . . We will do
great things for the world, and that for the sake of doing good and not
for name and fame. </p>
<p>""Ours not to reason why, ours but to do and die."" Be of good
cheer and believe that we are selected by the Lord to do great things,
and we will do them. Hold yourself in readiness, i.e. be pure and holy,
and love for love's sake. Love the poor, the miserable, the
downtrodden, and the Lord will bless you. </p>
<p>See the Raja of Ramnad and others from time to time and urge
them to sympathise with the masses of India. Tell them how they are
standing on the neck of the poor, and that they are not fit to be
called men if they do not try to raise them up. Be fearless, the Lord
is with you, and<!--'Volume 5 Page 24'--> He will yet
raise the starving and ignorant millions of India. A railway porter
here is better educated than many of your young men and most of your
princes. Every American woman has far better education than can be
conceived of by the majority of Hindu women. Why cannot we have the
same education? We must. </p>
<p>Think not that you are poor; money is not power, but goodness,
holiness. Come and see how it is so all over the world.</p>
<p class=""right"">Yours with blessings, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p><br>
PS. By the bye, your uncle's paper was the most curious phenomenon I
ever saw. It was like a tradesman's catalogue, and it was not thought
fit to be read in the Parliament. So Narasimhacharya read a few
extracts from it in a side hall, and nobody understood a word of it. Do
not tell him of it. It is a great art to press the largest amount of
thought into the smallest number of words. Even Manilal Dvivedi's paper
had to be cut very short. More than a thousand papers were read, and
there was no time to give to such wild perorations. I had a good long
time given to me over the ordinary half hour, . . . because the most
popular speakers were always put down last, to hold the audience. And
Lord bless them, what sympathy they have, and what patience! They would
sit from ten o'clock in the morning to ten o'clock at night &#8212; only a
recess of half an hour for a meal, and paper after paper read, most of
them very trivial, but they would wait and wait to hear their
favourites. </p>
<p>Dharmapâla of Ceylon was one of the favourites But
unfortunately he was not a good speaker. He had only quotations from
Max Müller and Rhys Davids to give them. He is a very sweet man, and we
became very intimate during the Parliament. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 25'-->
<p>A Christian lady from Poona, Miss Sorabji, and the Jain
representative, Mr. Gandhi, are going to remain longer in the country
and make lecture tours. I hope they will succeed. Lecturing is a very
profitable occupation in this country and sometimes pays well. </p>
<p>Mr. Ingersoll gets five to six hundred dollars a lecture. He
is the most celebrated lecturer in this country. Do not publish this
letter. After reading, send it to the Maharaja (of Khetri). I have sent
him my photograph in America.</p>

<p>DEAR HARIPADA, (Haripada Mitra) </p>
<p>It is very strange that news of my Chicago lectures has
appeared in the Indian papers; for whatever I do, I try my best to
avoid publicity. Many things strike me here. It may be fairly said that
there is no poverty in this country. I have never seen women elsewhere
as cultured and educated as they are here. Well-educated men there are
in our country, but you will scarcely find anywhere women like those
here. It is indeed true, that ""the Goddess Herself lives in the houses
of virtuous men as Lakshmi"".&nbsp; I have seen thousands of women
here whose hearts are as pure and stainless as snow. Oh, how free they
are! It is they who control social and civic duties Schools and
colleges are full of women, and in our country women cannot be safely
allowed to walk in the streets! Their kindness to me is immeasurable.
Since I came here, I have been welcomed by them to<!--'Volume 5 Page 26'-->
their houses. They are providing me with food, arranging for my
lectures, taking me to market, and doing everything for my comfort and
convenience. I shall never be able to repay in the least the deep debt
of gratitude I owe to them. </p>
<p>Do you know who is the real ""Shakti-worshipper""? It is he who
knows that God is the omnipresent force in the universe and sees in
women the manifestation of that Force. Many men here look upon their
women in this light. Manu, again, has said that gods bless those
families where women are happy and well treated. Here men treat their
women as well as can be desired, and hence they are so prosperous, so
learned, so free, and so energetic. But why is it that we are slavish,
miserable, and dead? The answer is obvious. </p>
<p>And how pure and chaste are they here! Few women are married
before twenty or twenty-five, and they are as free as the birds in the
air. They go to market, school, and college, earn money, and do all
kinds of work. Those who are well-to-do devote themselves to doing good
to the poor. And what are we doing? We are very regular in marrying our
girls at eleven years of age lest they should become corrupt and
immoral. What does our Manu enjoin? ""Daughters should be supported and
educated with as much care and attention as the sons."" As sons should
be married after observing Brahmacharya up to the thirtieth year, so
daughters also must observe Brahmacharya and be educated by their
parents. But what are we actually doing? Can you better the condition
of your women? Then there will be hope for your well-being. Otherwise
you will remain as backward as you are now. </p>
<p>If anybody is born of a low caste in our country, he is gone
for ever, there is no hope for him. Why? What a tyranny it is! There
are possibilities, opportunities, and hope for every individual in this
country. Today he is poor, tomorrow he may become rich and learned and<!--'Volume 5 Page 27'-->
respected. Here everyone is anxious to help the poor. In India there is
a howling cry that we are very poor, but how many charitable
associations are there for the well-being of the poor? How many people
really weep for the sorrows and sufferings of the millions of poor in
India? Are we <i>men</i>? What are we doing for their
livelihood, for their improvement? We do not touch them, we avoid their
company! Are we men? Those thousands of Brâhmanas &#8212; what are they doing
for the low, downtrodden masses of India? ""Don't touch"", ""Don't touch"",
is the only phrase that plays upon their lips! How mean and degraded
has our eternal religion become at their hands! Wherein does our
religion lie now? In ""Don't-touchism"" alone, and nowhere else! </p>
<p>I came to this country not to satisfy my curiosity, nor for
name or fame, but to see if I could find any means for the support of
the poor in India. If God helps me, you will know gradually what those
means are. </p>
<p>As regards spirituality, the Americans are far inferior to us,
but their society is far superior to ours. We will teach them our
spirituality and assimilate what is best in their society. </p>

541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO, <br>
<i>24th January, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS, (His disciples in Madras) </p>
<p>Your letters have reached me. I am surprised that so much
about me has reached you. The criticism you<!--'Volume 5 Page 28'-->
mention of the <i>Interior</i> is not to be taken as the
attitude of the American people. That paper is almost unknown here, and
belongs to what they call a ""blue-nose Presbyterian paper"", very
bigoted. Still all the ""blue-noses"" are not ungentlemanly. The American
people, and many of the clergy, are very hospitable to me. That paper
wanted a little notoriety by attacking a man who was being lionised by
society. That trick is well known here, and they do not think anything
of it. Of course, our Indian missionaries may try to make capital out
of it. If they do, tell them, ""Mark, Jew, a judgment has come upon
you!"" Their old building is tottering to its foundation and must come
down in spite of their hysterical shrieks. I pity them &#8212; if their means
of living fine lives in India is cut down by the influx of oriental
religions here. But not one of their leading clergy is ever against me.
Well, when I am in the pond, I must bathe thoroughly. </p>
<p>I send you a newspaper cutting of the short sketch of our
religion which I read before them. Most of my speeches are extempore. I
hope to put them in book form before I leave the country. I do not
require any help from India, I have plenty here. Employ the money you
have in printing and publishing this short speech; and translating it
into the vernaculars, throw it broadcast; that will keep us before the
national mind. In the meantime do not forget our plan of a central
college, and the starting from it to all directions in India. Work
hard. . . . </p>
<p>About the women of America, I cannot express my gratitude for
their kindness. Lord bless them. In this country, women are the life of
every movement, and represent all the culture of the nation, for men
are too busy to educate themselves. </p>
<p>I have received Kidi's letters. With the question whether
caste shall go or come I have nothing to do. My idea is to bring to the
door of the meanest, the poorest,<!--'Volume 5 Page 29'-->
the noble ideas that the human race has developed both in and out of
India, and let them think for themselves. Whether there should be caste
or not, whether women should be perfectly free or not, does not concern
me. ""Liberty of thought and action is the only condition of life, of
growth and well-being."" Where it does not exist, the man, the race, the
nation must go down. </p>
<p>Caste or no caste, creed or no creed, any man, or class, or
caste, or nation, or institution which bars the power of free thought
and action of an individual &#8212; even so long as that power does not
injure others &#8212; is devilish and must go down.</p>
<p>My whole ambition in life is to set in motion a machinery
which will bring noble ideas to the door of everybody, and then let men
and women settle their own fate. Let them know what our forefathers as
well as other nations have thought on the most momentous questions of
life. Let them see specially what others are doing now, and then
decide. We are to put the chemicals together, the crystallization will
be done by nature according to her laws. Work hard, be steady, and have
faith in the Lord. Set to work, I am coming sooner or later. Keep the
motto before you &#8212; ""Elevation of the masses without injuring their
religion"". </p>
<p>Remember that the nation lives in the cottage. But, alas!
nobody ever did anything for them. Our modern reformers are very busy
about widow remarriage. Of course, I am a sympathiser in every reform,
but the fate of a nation does not depend upon the number of husbands
their widows get, but upon the <i>condition of the masses</i>.
Can you raise them? Can you give them back their lost individuality
without making them lose their innate spiritual nature? Can you become
an occidental of occidentals in your spirit of equality, freedom, work,
and energy, and at the same time a Hindu to the very backbone in
religious culture and instincts? This is to be done and<!--'Volume 5 Page 30'-->
<i>we
will do it</i>. You are all <i>born to do it</i>.
Have faith in yourselves, great convictions are the mothers of great
deeds. Onward for ever! Sympathy for the poor, the downtrodden, even
unto death &#8212; this is our motto. </p>

PS. Do not publish this letter; but there is no harm in preaching the
idea of elevating the masses by means of a central college, and
bringing education as well as religion to the door of the poor by means
of missionaries trained in this college. Try to interest everybody. </p>
<p>I send you a few newspaper cuttings &#8212; only from the very best
and highest. The one by Dr. Thomas is very valuable as written by one
of the, if not the leading clergymen of America. The <i>Interior</i>

I was the public favourite. I cut a few lines from that magazine also. </p>

<p class=""right"">NEW YORK, <br>
<i>9th April, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I got your last letter a few days ago. You see I am so very
busy here, and have to write so many letters every day, that you cannot
expect frequent communications from me. But I try my best to keep you
in touch with whatever is going on here. I will write to Chicago for
one of the books on the Parliament of Religions to be<!--'Volume 5 Page 31'-->
sent over to you. But by this time you have got two of my short
speeches. </p>
<p>Secretary Saheb writes me that I must come back to India,
because that is my field. No doubt of that. But my brother, we are to
light a torch which will shed a lustre over all India. So let us not be
in a hurry; everything will come by the grace of the Lord. I have
lectured in many of the big towns of America, and have got enough to
pay my passage back after paying the awful expenses here. I have made a
good many friends here, some of them very influential. Of course, the
orthodox clergymen are against me; and seeing that it is not easy to
grapple with me, they try to hinder, abuse, and vilify me in every way;
and Mazoomdar has come to their help. He must have gone mad with
jealousy. He has told them that I was a big fraud, and a rogue! And
again in Calcutta he is telling them that I am leading a most sinful
life in America, specially unchaste! Lord bless him! My brother, no
good thing can be done without obstruction. It is only those who
persevere to the end that succeed. . . . I believe that the Satya Yuga
(Golden Age) will come when there will be one caste, one Veda, and
peace and harmony. This idea of Satya Yuga is what would revivify
India. Believe it. One thing is to be done if you can do it. Can you
convene a big meeting in Madras, getting Ramnad or any such big fellow
as the President, and pass a resolution of your entire satisfaction at
my representation of Hinduism here, and send it to the <i>Chicago
Herald</i>, <i>Inter-Ocean</i>, and the <i>New
York Sun</i>, and the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>
of Detroit (Michigan). Chicago is in Illinois. <i>New York Sun</i>
requires no particulars. Detroit is in the State of Michigan. Send
copies to Dr. Barrows, Chairman of the Parliament of Religions,
Chicago. I have forgotten his number, but the street is Indiana Avenue.
One copy to Mrs. J. J. Bagley of Detroit, Washington Ave. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 32'-->
<p>Try to make this meeting as big as possible. Get hold of all
the big bugs who must join it for their religion and country. Try to
get a letter from the Mysore Maharaja and the Dewan approving the
meeting and its purpose &#8212; so of Khetri &#8212; in fact, as big and noisy a
crowd as you can. </p>
<p>The resolution would be of such a nature that the Hindu
community of Madras, who sent me over, expressing its entire
satisfaction in my work here etc. </p>
<p>Now try if it is possible. This is not much work. Get also
letters of sympathy from all parts you can and print them and send
copies to the American papers &#8212; as quickly as you can. That will go a
long way, my brethren. The B&#8212; S&#8212; fellows here are trying to talk all
sorts of nonsense. We must stop their mouths as fast as we can. </p>
<p>Up boys, and put yourselves to the task! If you can do that, I
am sure we will be able to do much in future. Old Hinduism for ever!
Down with all liars and rogues! Up, up, my boys, we are sure to win! </p>
<p>As to publishing my letters, such parts as ought to be
published may be published for our friends till I come. When once we
begin to work, we shall have a tremendous ""boom"", but I do not want to
talk without working. I do not know, but G. C. Ghosh and Mr. Mitra of
Calcutta can get up all the sympathisers of my late Gurudeva to do the
same in Calcutta. If they can, so much the better. Ask them, if they
can, to pass the same resolutions in Calcutta. There are thousands in
Calcutta who sympathise with our movement. However I have more faith in
you than in them. </p>
<p>Nothing more to write.</p>
<p>Convey my greetings to all our friends &#8212; for whom I am always
praying.</p>

Can you convene a big meeting in Madras, getting Ramnad or any such big fellow as the President, and pass a resolution of your entire satisfaction at my representation of Hinduism here, and send it to theChicago Herald,Inter-Ocean, and theNew York Sun, and theCommercial Advertiserof Detroit (Michigan). Chicago is in Illinois.New York Sunrequires no particulars. Detroit is in the State of Michigan. Send copies to Dr. Barrows, Chairman of the Parliament of Religions, Chicago. I have forgotten his number, but the street is Indiana Avenue. One copy to Mrs. J. J. Bagley of Detroit, Washington Ave.

Try to make this meeting as big as possible. Get hold of all the big bugs who must join it for their religion and country. Try to get a letter from the Mysore Maharaja and the Dewan approving the meeting and its purpose — so of Khetri — in fact, as big and noisy a crowd as you can.

The resolution would be of such a nature that the Hindu community of Madras, who sent me over, expressing its entire satisfaction in my work here etc.

Now try if it is possible. This is not much work. Get also letters of sympathy from all parts you can and print them and send copies to the American papers — as quickly as you can. That will go a long way, my brethren. The B— S— fellows here are trying to talk all sorts of nonsense. We must stop their mouths as fast as we can.

Up boys, and put yourselves to the task! If you can do that, I am sure we will be able to do much in future. Old Hinduism for ever! Down with all liars and rogues! Up, up, my boys, we are sure to win!

As to publishing my letters, such parts as ought to be published may be published for our friends till I come. When once we begin to work, we shall have a tremendous ""boom"", but I do not want to talk without working. I do not know, but G. C. Ghosh and Mr. Mitra of Calcutta can get up all the sympathisers of my late Gurudeva to do the same in Calcutta. If they can, so much the better. Ask them, if they can, to pass the same resolutions in Calcutta. There are thousands in Calcutta who sympathise with our movement. However I have more faith in you than in them.

Nothing more to write.

Convey my greetings to all our friends — for whom I am always praying.","Yours with blessings,

<p>MY DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA), </p>
<p>I am in receipt of your letter and am glad to learn that
Shashi (Ramakrishnananda) is all right. Now I tell you a curious fact.
Whenever anyone of you is sick, let him himself or anyone of you
visualise him in your mind, and mentally say and strongly imagine that
he is all right. That will cure him quickly. You can do it even without
his knowledge, and even with thousands of miles between you. Remember
it and do not be ill any more. You have received the money by this
time. If you all like, you can give to Gopal Rs. 300/- from the amount
I sent for the Math. I have no more to send now. I have to look after
Madras now. </p>
<p>I cannot understand why Sanyal is so miserable on account of
his daughters' marriage. After all, he is going to drag his daughters
through the dirty Samsâra (world) which he himself wants to escape! I
can have but one opinion of that &#8212; condemnation! I hate the very name
of marriage, in regard to a boy or a girl. Do you mean to say that I
have to help in putting someone into bondage, you fool! If my brother
Mohin marries, I will throw him off. I am very decided about that. . . .</p>

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I could not reply to your note earlier, because I was whirling
to and fro from New York to Boston, and also<!--'Volume 5 Page 34'-->
I awaited Narasimha's letter. I do not know when I am going back to
India. It is better to leave everything in the hands of Him who is at
my back directing me. Try to work without me, as if I never existed. Do
not wait for anybody or anything. Do whatever you can. Build your hope
on none. Before writing about myself, I will tell you about Narasimha.
He has proved a complete failure. . . . However he wrote to me for help
in the last stage, and I will try to help him as much as is in my
power. Meanwhile you tell his people to send money as soon as they can
for him to go over. . . . He is in distress. Of course I will see that
he does not starve. </p>
<p>I have done a good deal of lecturing here.... The expenses
here are terrible; money has to fly, although I have been almost always
taken care of everywhere by the nicest and the highest families. </p>
<p>I do not know whether I shall go away this summer or not. Most
probably not. In the meantime try to organise and push on our plans.
Believe you can do everything. Know that the Lord is with us, and so,
onward, brave souls! </p>
<p>I have had enough appreciation in my own country. Appreciation
or no appreciation, sleep not, slacken not. You must remember that not
a bit even of our plans has been as yet carried out. </p>
<p>Act on the educated young men, bring them together, and
organise them. Great things can be done by great sacrifices only. No
selfishness, no name, no fame, yours or mine, nor my Master's even!
Work, work the idea, the plan, my boys, my brave, noble, good souls &#8212;
to the wheel, to the wheel put your shoulders! Stop not to look back
for name, or fame, or any such nonsense. Throw self overboard and work.
Remember, ""The grass when made into a rope by being joined together can
even chain a mad elephant."" The Lord's blessings on you all! His power
be in you all&#8212; as I believe it is<!--'Volume 5 Page 35'-->

""Wake up, stop not until the goal is reached"", say the Vedas. Up, up,
the long night is passing, the day is approaching, the wave has risen,
nothing will be able to resist its tidal fury. The spirit, my boys, the
spirit; the love, my children, the love; the faith, the belief; and
fear not! The greatest sin is fear. </p>
<p>My blessings on all. Tell all the noble souls in Madras who
have helped our cause that I send them my eternal love and gratitude,
but I beg of them not to slacken. Throw the idea broadcast. Do not be
proud; do not insist upon anything dogmatic; do not go against anything

fiat of the Lord has gone forth &#8212; India must rise, the masses and the
poor are to be made happy. Rejoice that you are the chosen instruments
in His hands. The flood of spirituality has risen. I see it is rolling
over the land resistless, boundless, all-absorbing. Every man to the
fore, every good will be added to its forces, every hand will smooth
its way, and glory be unto the Lord! . . . </p>
<p>I do not require any help. Try to get up a fund, buy some
magic-lanterns, maps, globes, etc., and some chemicals. Get every
evening a crowd of the poor and low, even the Pariahs, and lecture to
them about religion first, and then teach them through the
magic-lantern and other things, astronomy, geography, etc., in the
dialect of the people. Train up a band of fiery young men. Put your
fire in them and gradually increase the organization, letting it widen
and widen its circle. Do the best you can, do not wait to cross the
river when the water has all run down. Printing magazines, papers,
etc., are good, no doubt, but actual work, my boys even if
infinitesimal, is better than eternal scribbling and talking. Call a
meeting<!--'Volume 5 Page 35'--> at Bhattacharya's. Get a
little money and buy those things I have just now stated, hire a hut,
and go to work. Magazines are secondary, but this is primary. You must
have a hold on the masses. Do not be afraid of a small beginning, great
things come afterwards. Be courageous. Do not try to lead your
brethren, but serve them. The brutal mania for leading has sunk many a
great ship in the waters of life. Take care especially of that, i.e. be
unselfish even unto death, and work. I could not write all I was going
to say, but the Lord will give you all understanding, my brave boys. At
it, my boys! Glory unto the Lord! . . .</p>

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>You must never write to me anywhere else but 541 Dearborn
Ave., Chicago. Your last letter has travelled the whole country to come
to me, and this was only because I am so well known. Some of the
resolutions are to be sent to Dr. Barrows with a letter thanking him
for his kindness to me and asking him to publish the letter in some
American newspapers &#8212; as that would be the best refutation of the false
charges of the missionaries that I do not represent anybody. Learn
business, my boy. We will do great things yet! Last year I only sowed
the seeds; this year I mean to reap. In the meanwhile, keep up as much
enthusiasm as possible in India. Let Kidi go his own way. He will come
out all right in time. I have taken his responsibility. He has a
perfect right to his own opinion. Make him write for the paper; that
will keep him in good temper! My blessings on him. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 37'-->
<p>Start the journal and I will send you articles from time to
time. You must send a paper and a letter to Professor J. H. Wright of
Harvard University, Boston, thanking him as having been the first man
who stood as my friend and asking him to publish it in the papers, thus
giving the lie to the missionaries. </p>
<p>In the Detroit lecture I got $900, i.e. Rs. 2,700. In other
lectures, I earned in one, $2,500, i.e. Rs. 7,500 in one hour, but got
only 200 dollars! I was cheated by a roguish Lecture Bureau. I have
given them up. I spent a good deal here; only about $3,000 remains. </p>
<p>I shall have to print much matter next year. I am going
regularly to work. . . . The sheer power of the <i>will</i>
will do everything. . . . You must organise a society which should
regularly meet, and write to me about it as often as you can. In fact,
get up as much enthusiasm as you can. Only, <i>beware</i>
of falsehood. Go to work, my boys, the fire will come to you! The
faculty of organisation is entirely absent in our nature, but this has
to be infused. The great secret is &#8212; absence of jealousy. Be always
ready to concede to the opinions of your brethren, and try always to
conciliate. That is the whole secret. Fight on bravely! Life is short!
Give it up to a great cause. Why do you not write anything about
Narasimha? He is almost starving. I gave him something. Then he went
over to somewhere, I do not know where, and does not write. Akshaya is
a good boy. I like him very much. No use quarrelling with the
Theosophists. Do not go and tell them all I write to you. . . .
Theosophists are our pioneers, do you know? Now Judge is a Hindu and
Col. a Buddhist, and Judge is the ablest man here. Now tell the Hindu
Theosophists to support Judge. Even if you can write Judge a letter,
thanking him as a co-religionist and for his labours in presenting
Hinduism before Americans; that will do his heart much good. We must
not join any sect, but we must<!--'Volume 5 Page 38'-->
sympathise and work with each. . . . Work, work &#8212; conquer all by your
love! . . . </p>
<p>Try to expand. Remember the <i>only sign of life</i>
is motion and growth. You must send the passed resolution to Dr. J. H.
Barrows. . ., Dr. Paul Carus. . ., Senator Palmer. . ., Mrs. J. J.
Bagley. . ., it must come officially. . . . I write this because I do
not think you know the ways of foreign nations. . . . Keep on steadily.
So far we have done wonderful things. Onward, brave souls, we will
gain! Organise and found societies and go to work, that is the only
way. </p>
<p>At this time of the year there is not much lecturing to be
done here; so I will devote myself to my pen and write. I shall be hard
at work all the time, and then, when the cold weather comes and people
return to their homes, I shall begin lecturing again and at the same
time organise societies. </p>

<p>DEAR SISTER, (Isabelle McKindley) </p>
<p>Your very kind letter duly reached me at Annisquam. I am with
the Bagleys once more. They are kind as usual. Professor Wright was not
here. But he came day before yesterday and we have very nice time<!--'Volume 5 Page 39'-->
together. Mr. Bradley of Evanston, whom you have met at Evanston, was
here. His sister-in-law had me sit for a picture several days and had
painted me. I had some very fine boating and one evening overturned the
boat and had a good drenching &#8212; clothes and all. </p>
<p>I had very very nice time at Greenacre. They were all so
earnest and kind people. Fanny Hartley and Mrs. Mills have by this time
gone back home I suppose. </p>
<p>From here I think I will go back to New York. Or I may go to
Boston to Mrs. Ole Bull. Perhaps you have heard of Mr. Ole Bull, the
great violinist of this country. She is his widow. She is a very
spiritual lady. She lives in Cambridge and has a fine big parlour made
of woodwork brought all the way from India. She wants me to come over
to her any time and use her parlour to lecture. Boston of course is the
great field for everything, but the Boston people as quickly take hold
of anything as give it up; while the New Yorkers are slow, but when
they get hold of anything they do it with a mortal grip. </p>
<p>I have kept pretty good health all the time and hope to do in
the future. I had no occasion yet to draw on my reserve, yet I am
rolling on pretty fair. And I have given up all money-making schemes
and will be quite satisfied with a bite and a shed and work on. </p>
<p>I believe you are enjoying your summer retreat. Kindly convey
my best regards and love to Miss Howe and Mr. Frank Howe. </p>
<p>Perhaps I did not tell you in my last how I slept and lived
and preached under the trees and for a few days at least found myself
once more in the atmosphere of heaven. </p>
<p>Most probably I will make New York my centre for the next
winter; and as soon as I fix on that, I will write to you. I am not yet
settled in my ideas of remaining in this country any more. I cannot
settle anything of that sort. I must bide my time. May the Lord bless

<p class=""right"">U. S. A., <br>
<i>31st August, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I just now saw an editorial on me about the circular from
Madras in the <i>Boston Transcript</i>. Nothing has
reached me yet. They will reach me soon if you have sent them already.
So far you have done wonderfully, my boy. Do not mind what I write in
some moments of nervousness. One gets nervous sometimes alone in a
country 15,000 miles from home, having to fight every inch of ground
with orthodox inimical Christians. You must take those into
consideration, my brave boy, and work right along. </p>
<p>Perhaps you have heard from Bhattacharya that I received a
beautiful letter from G. G. His address was scrawled in such a fashion
as to become perfectly illegible to me. So I could not reply to him
direct. But I have done all that he desired. I have sent over my
photograph and written to the Raja of Mysore. Now I have sent a
phonograph to Khetri Raja. . . . </p>
<p>Now send always Indian newspapers about me to me over here. I
want to read them in the papers themselves &#8212; do you know? Now lastly,
you must write to me all about Mr. Charu Chandra who has been so kind
to me. Give him my heartfelt thanks; but (between you and me) I
unfortunately do not remember him. Would you give me particulars? </p>
<p>The Theosophists here now like me, but they are 650 in all!!
There are the Christian Scientists. All of<!--'Volume 5 Page 41'-->
them like me. They are about a million. I work with both, but join
none, and will with the Lord's grace would them both after the true
fashion; for they are after all mumbling half realised truth.
Narasimha, perhaps, by the time this reaches you, will get the money
etc. </p>
<p>I have received a letter from <i>Cat</i>, but it
requires a book to answer all his queries. So I send him my blessings
through you and ask you to remind him that we agree to differ &#8212; and see
the harmony of contrary points. So it does not matter what he believes
in; he must act. Give my love to Balaji, G. G., Kidi, Doctor, and to
all our friends and all the great and patriotic souls, who were brave
and noble enough to sink their differences for their country's cause. </p>
<p>With a magazine or journal or organ &#8212; you become the Secretary
thereof. You calculate the cost of starting the magazine and the work,
how much the least is necessary to start it, and then write to me
giving name and address of the Society, and I will send you money
myself, and not only that, I will get others in America to subscribe
annually to it liberally. So ask them of Calcutta to do the same. Give
me Dharmapala's address. He is a great and good man. He will work
wonderfully with us. Now organise a little society. You will have to
take charge of the whole movement, not as a <i>leader</i>,
but as a <i>servant</i>. Do you know, the least show of
leading destroys everything by rousing jealousy? </p>
<p>Accede to everything. Only try to retain all of my friends
together. Do you see? And work slowly up. Let G. G. and others, who
have no immediate necessity for earning something, do as they are
doing, i.e. casting the idea broadcast. G. G. is doing well at Mysore.
That is the way. Mysore will be in time a great stronghold. </p>
<p>I am now going to write my <i>mems</i> in a book
and <i>next</i> winter will go about this country
organising <i>societies</i><!--'Volume 5 Page 42'-->
here. This is a great field of work, and everything done here prepares <i>England</i>.
So far you have done very well indeed, my brave boy &#8212; all strength
shall be given to you. </p>
<p>I have now Rs. 9,000 with me, part of which I will send over
to you for the organisation; and I will get many people to send money
to you in Madras yearly, half-yearly, or monthly. You now start a
Society and a journal and the necessary apparatus. This must be a
secret amongst only a few &#8212; but at the same time try to collect funds
from Mysore and elsewhere to build a temple in Madras which should have
a library and some rooms for the office and the preachers who should be
Sannyâsins, and for Vairâgis (men of renunciation) who may chance to
come. Thus we shall progress inch by inch. This is a great field for my
work, and everything done here prepares the way for my coming work in
England. . . . </p>
<p>You know the greatest difficulty with me is to keep or even to
touch money. It is disgusting and debasing. So you must organise a
Society to take charge of the practical and pecuniary part of it. I
have friends here who take care of all my monetary concerns. Do you
see? It will be a wonderful relief to me to get rid of horrid money
affairs. So the sooner you organise yourselves and you be ready as
secretary and treasurer to enter into direct communication with my
friends and sympathisers here, the better for you and me. Do that
quickly, and write to me. Give the society a non-sectarian name. . . Do
you write to my brethren at the Math to organise in a similar fashion.
. . . Great things are in store for you Alasinga. Or if you think
proper, you get some of the big folks to be named as office-bearers of
the Society, while you work in the real sense. Their name will be a
great thing. If your duties are too severe and do not let you have any
time, let G. G. do the business part, and by and by I hope to make you
independent of your college work so that you may, without starving
yourself<!--'Volume 5 Page 43'--> and family, devote your
whole soul to the work. So work, my boys, work! The rough part of the
work has been smoothened and rounded; now it will roll on better and
better every year. And if you can simply keep it going well until I
come to India, the work will progress by leaps and bounds. Rejoice that
you have done so much. When you feel gloomy, think what has been done
within the last year. How, rising from nothing, we have the eyes of the
world fixed upon us now. Not only India, but the world outside, is
expecting great things of us. Missionaries or M &#8212; or foolish officials
&#8212; none will be able to resist truth and love and sincerity. Are you
sincere? unselfish even unto death? and loving? Then fear not, not even
death. Onward, my lads! The whole world requires Light. It is
expectant! India alone has that Light, not in magic, mummery, and
charlatanism, but in the teaching of the glories of the spirit of real
religion &#8212; of the highest spiritual truth. That is why the Lord has
preserved the race through all its vicissitudes unto the present day.
Now the time has come. Have faith that you are all, my brave lads, born
to do great things! Let not the barks of puppies frighten you &#8212; no, not
even the thunderbolts of heaven &#8212; but stand up and work! </p>

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>. . . I have been continuously travelling from place to place
and working incessantly, giving lectures, holding classes, etc. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 44'-->
<p>I have not been able to write yet for my proposed book.
Perhaps I may be able to take it in hand later on. I have made some
nice friends here amongst the liberal people, and a few amongst the
orthodox. I hope to return soon to India &#8212; I have had enough of this
country and especially as too much work is making me nervous. The
giving of too many public lectures and constant hurry have brought on
this nervousness. I do not care for this busy, meaningless,
money-making life. So you see, I will soon return. Of course, there is
a growing section with whom I am very popular, and who will like to
have me here all the time. But I think I have had enough of newspaper
blazoning and humbugging of a public life. I do not care the least for
it. . . . </p>
<p>There is no hope for money for our project here. It is useless
to hope. No large number of men in any country do good out of mere
sympathy. The few who really give money in the Christian lands often do
so through priestcraft and fear of hell. So it is as in our Bengali
proverb, ""Kill a cow and make a pair of shoes out of the leather and
give them in charity to a Brahmana"". So it is here, and so everywhere;
and then, the Westerners are miserly in comparison to our race. I
sincerely believe that the Asians are the most charitable race in the
world, only they are very poor. </p>
<p>I am going to live for a few months in New York. That city is
the head, hand, and purse of the country. Of course, Boston is called
the Brahmanical city, and here in America there are hundreds of
thousands that sympathise with me. . . . The New York people are very
open. I will see what can be done there, as I have some very
influential friends. After all, I am getting disgusted with this
lecturing business. It will take a long time for the Westerners to
understand the higher spirituality, Everything is £. s. d. to them. If
a religion brings them<!--'Volume 5 Page 45'--> money or
health or beauty or long life, they will all flock to it, otherwise
not. . . . </p>
<p>Give to Balaji, G. G., and all of our friends my best love.</p>

I am very sorry to hear your determination of giving up the world so soon. The fruit falls from the tree when it gets ripe. So wait for the time to come. Do not hurry.

<p>You all have done well, my brave unselfish children. I am so
proud of you. . . . Hope and do not despair. After such a start, if you
despair you are a fool. . . . </p>
<p>Our field is India, and the value of foreign appreciation is

<p>You need not be sorry, my son, on account of the young men
becoming Christians. What else can they be under the existing social
bondages, especially in Madras? Liberty is the first condition of
growth. Your ancestors gave every liberty to the soul, and religion
grew. They put the body under every bondage, and society did not grow.
The opposite is the case in the West &#8212; every liberty to society, none
to religion. Now are falling off the shackles from the feet of Eastern
society as from those of Western religion. </p>
<p>Each again will have its type; the religious or introspective
in India, the scientific or out-seeing in the West. The West wants
every bit of spirituality through social improvement. The East wants
every bit of social power through spirituality. Thus it was that the
modern reformers saw no way to reform but by first crushing out the
religion of India. They tried, and they failed. Why? Because few of
them ever studied their own religion, and not <i>one</i>
ever <i>underwent</i> the training necessary to understand
the <i>Mother of all religions</i>. I claim that no
destruction of religion is necessary to improve the Hindu society, and
that this state of society exists not on account of religion, but
because religion has not been
<!--'Volume 5 Page 48'-->applied to society as it should
have been. This I am ready to prove from our old books, every word of
it. This is what I teach, and this is what we must struggle all our
lives to carry out. But it will take time, a long time to study. Have
patience and work.&nbsp;&#2313;&#2343;&#2381;&#2342;&#2352;&#2375;&#2342;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2344;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381; &#8212; Save yourself by

<p class=""right"">WASHINGTON, <br>
<i>27th October, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>BLESSED AND BELOVED, (Alasinga Perumal) </p>
<p>By this time you must have received my other letters. You must
excuse me for certain harshness of tone sometimes, and you know full
well how I love you. You have asked me often to send over to you all
about my movements in this country and all my lecture reports. I am
doing exactly here what I used to do in India. Always depending on the
Lord and making no plans ahead.... Moreover you must remember that I
have to work incessantly in this country, and that I have no time to
put together my thoughts in the form of a book, so much so, that this
constant rush has worn my nerves, and I am feeling it. I cannot express
my obligation to you, G. G., and all my friends in Madras, for the most
unselfish and heroic work you did for me. But it was not at all meant
to blazon me, but to make you conscious of your own strength. I am not
an organiser, my nature tends towards scholarship and meditation. I
think I have worked enough, now I want rest and to teach a little to
those that have come to me from my Gurudeva (venerable Guru). You have
known now what you can do, for it is really you, young men of Madras,
that have done all; I am only the figurehead. I am a Tyâgi (detached)
monk. I only want one thing. I do not believe in a God or religion
which cannot wipe the widow's tears or bring a piece of bread to the
orphan's mouth. However sublime be the theories, however well-spun may
be the philosophy &#8212; I do not call it religion so long as it is confined
to books and dogmas. The eye is in the forehead and not in the back.
Move onward and carry into practice that which you are very proud to
call your religion, and God bless you! </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 51'-->
<p>Look not at me, look to yourselves. I am happy to have been
the occasion of rousing an enthusiasm. Take advantage of it, float
along with it, and everything will come right. Love never fails, my
son; today or tomorrow or ages after, truth will conquer. Love shall
win the victory. Do you love your fellow men? Where should you go to
seek for God &#8212; are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, Gods? Why
not worship them first? Why go to dig a well on the shores of the
Gangâ? Believe in the omnipotent power of love. Who cares for these
tinsel puffs of name? I never keep watch of what the newspapers are
saying. Have you love? &#8212; You are omnipotent. Are you perfectly
unselfish? If so, you are irresistible. It is character that pays
everywhere. It is the Lord who protects His children in the depths of
the sea. Your country requires heroes; be heroes! God bless you! </p>
<p>Everybody wants me to come over to India. They think we shall
be able to do more if I come over. They are mistaken, my friend. The
present enthusiasm is only a little patriotism, it means nothing. If it
is true and genuine, you will find in a short time hundreds of heroes
coming forward and carrying on the work. Therefore know that you have
really done all, and go on. Look not for me. Akshoy Kumar Ghosh is in
London. He sent a beautiful invitation from London to come to Miss
Müller's. And I hope I am going in January or February next.
Bhattacharya writes me to come over. Here is a grand field. What have I
to do with this ""ism"" or that ""ism""? I am the servant of the Lord, and
where on earth is there a better field than here for propagating all
high ideas? Here, where if one man is against me, a hundred hands are

By this time you must have received my other letters. You must excuse me for certain harshness of tone sometimes, and you know full well how I love you. You have asked me often to send over to you all about my movements in this country and all my lecture reports. I am doing exactly here what I used to do in India. Always depending on the Lord and making no plans ahead.... Moreover you must remember that I have to work incessantly in this country, and that I have no time to put together my thoughts in the form of a book, so much so, that this constant rush has worn my nerves, and I am feeling it. I cannot express my obligation to you, G. G., and all my friends in Madras, for the most unselfish and heroic work you did for me. But it was not at all meant to blazon me, but to make you conscious of your own strength. I am not an organiser, my nature tends towards scholarship and meditation. I think I have worked enough, now I want rest and to teach a little to those that have come to me from my Gurudeva (venerable Guru). You have known now what you can do, for it is really you, young men of Madras, that have done all; I am only the figurehead. I am a Tyâgi (detached) monk. I only want one thing. I do not believe in a God or religion which cannot wipe the widow's tears or bring a piece of bread to the orphan's mouth. However sublime be the theories, however well-spun may be the philosophy — I do not call it religion so long as it is confined to books and dogmas. The eye is in the forehead and not in the back. Move onward and carry into practice that which you are very proud to call your religion, and God bless you!

Look not at me, look to yourselves. I am happy to have been the occasion of rousing an enthusiasm. Take advantage of it, float along with it, and everything will come right. Love never fails, my son; today or tomorrow or ages after, truth will conquer. Love shall win the victory. Do you love your fellow men? Where should you go to seek for God — are not all the poor, the miserable, the weak, Gods? Why not worship them first? Why go to dig a well on the shores of the Gangâ? Believe in the omnipotent power of love. Who cares for these tinsel puffs of name? I never keep watch of what the newspapers are saying. Have you love? — You are omnipotent. Are you perfectly unselfish? If so, you are irresistible. It is character that pays everywhere. It is the Lord who protects His children in the depths of the sea. Your country requires heroes; be heroes! God bless you!

Everybody wants me to come over to India. They think we shall be able to do more if I come over. They are mistaken, my friend. The present enthusiasm is only a little patriotism, it means nothing. If it is true and genuine, you will find in a short time hundreds of heroes coming forward and carrying on the work. Therefore know that you have really done all, and go on. Look not for me. Akshoy Kumar Ghosh is in London. He sent a beautiful invitation from London to come to Miss Müller's. And I hope I am going in January or February next. Bhattacharya writes me to come over. Here is a grand field. What have I to do with this ""ism"" or that ""ism""? I am the servant of the Lord, and where on earth is there a better field than here for propagating all high ideas? Here, where if one man is against me, a hundred hands are ready to help me; here, where man feels for man, weeps for his fellow-men and women are goddesses! Even idiots may stand up to hear themselves praised, and cowards assume the attitude of thebrave when everything is sure to turn out well, but the true hero works in silence. How many Buddhas die before one finds expression! My son, I believe in God, and I believe in man. I believe in helping the miserable. I believe in going even to hell to save others.

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I am glad to leant that the phonograph and the letter have
reached you safely. You need not send any more newspaper cuttings. I
have been deluged with them. Enough of that. Now go to work for the
organisation. I have started one already in New York and the
Vice-President will soon write to you. Keep correspondence with them.
Soon I hope to get up a few in other places. We must organise our
forces not to make a sect &#8212; not on religious matters, but on the
secular business part of it.<!--'Volume 5 Page 53'--> A
stirring propaganda must be launched out. Put your heads together and

<p>What nonsense about the miracle of Ramakrishna! . . .Miracles
I do not know nor understand. Had Ramakrishna nothing to do in the
world but turning wine into the Gupta's medicine? Lord save me from
such Calcutta people! What materials to work with! If they can write a
real life of Shri Ramakrishna with the idea of showing what he came to
do and teach, let them do it, otherwise let them not distort his life
and sayings. These people want to know God who see in Shri Ramakrishna
nothing but jugglery! . . . Now let Kidi translate his love, his
knowledge, his teachings, his eclecticism, etc. This is the theme. The
life of Shri Ramakrishna was an extraordinary searchlight under whose
illumination one is able to really understand the whole scope of Hindu
religion. He was the object-lesson of all the theoretical knowledge
given in the Shâstras (scriptures). He showed by his life what the
Rishis and Avatâras really wanted to teach. The books were theories, he
was the realisation. This man had in fifty-one years lived the five
thousand years of national spiritual life and so raised himself to be
an object-lesson for future generations. The Vedas can only be
explained and the Shastras reconciled by his theory calf Avasthâ or
stages &#8212; that we must not only tolerate others, but positively embrace
them, and that truth is the basis of all religions. Now on these lines
a most impressive and beautiful life can be written. Well, everything
in good time. Avoid all irregular indecent expressions about sex etc. .
., because other nations think it the height of indecency to mention
such things, and his life in English is going to be read by the whole
world. I read a Bengali life sent over. It is full of such words. . .
.So take care. Carefully avoid such words and expressions. The Calcutta
friends have not a cent worth of ability; but they have their
assertions of individuality.<!--'Volume 5 Page 54'--> They
are too high to listen to advice. I do not know what to do with these
wonderful gentlemen. I have not got much hope in that quarter. <i>His
will be done</i>. I am simply ashamed of the Bengali book. The
writer perhaps thought he was a frank recorder of truth and keeping the
very language of Paramahamsa. But he does not remember that Ramakrishna
would never use that language before ladies. And this man expects his
work to be read by men and women alike! Lord, save me from fools! They,
again, have their own freaks; they all knew him! <i>Bosh and rot</i>.
. . . Beggars taking upon themselves the air of kings! Fools thinking
they are all wise! Puny slaves thinking that they are masters! That is
their condition. I do not know what to do. Lord save me. I have all

Calcutta people. Keep them in good humour in the hope that some one of
them may turn good. But push on with your work independently. ""Many

Ramakrishna, I advise you to keep clear of them and the fools who write
them. They are true, but the fools will make a mess of the whole thing,

<h2>XXV</h2>
<p class=""right"">541 DEARBORN AVENUE, <br>
<i>Chicago, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>Your letter just to hand. . . . I was mistaken in asking you
to publish the scraps I sent you. It was one of my awful mistakes. It
shows a moment's weakness. Money can be raised in this country by
lecturing for two or three years. But I have tried a little, and
although there is much public appreciation of my work, it is thoroughly
uncongenial and demoralising to me. . . .</p>
<p>I have read what you say about the Indian papers and their
criticisms, which are natural. Jealousy is the central vice of every
enslaved race. And it is jealousy and want of combination which cause
and perpetuate slavery. You cannot feel the truth of this remark until
you come out of India. The secret of Westerners' success is this power
of combination, the basis of which is mutual trust and appreciation.
The weaker and more cowardly a nation is, so much the more is this sin
visible. . . . But, my son, you ought not to expect anything from a
slavish race. The case is almost desperate no doubt, but let me put the
case before you all. Can you put life into this dead mass &#8212; dead to
almost all moral aspiration, dead<!--'Volume 5 Page 57'-->
to all future possibilities &#8212; and always ready to spring upon those
that would try to do good to them? Can you take the position of a
physician who tries to pour medicine down the throat of a kicking and
refractory child? . . . An American or a European always supports his
countrymen in a foreign country. . . . Let me remind you again, ""Thou
hast the right to work but not to the fruits thereof."" Stand firm like
a rock. Truth always triumphs. Let the children of Shri Ramakrishna be
true to themselves and everything will be all right. We may not live to
see the outcome, but as sure as we live, it will come sooner or later.
What India wants is a new electric fire to stir up a fresh vigour in
the national veins. This was ever, and always will be, slow work. Be
content to work, and, above all, be true to yourself. Be pure, staunch,
and sincere to the very backbone, and everything will be all right. If
you have marked anything in the disciples of Shri Ramakrishna, it is
this &#8212; they are sincere to the backbone. My task will be done, and I
shall be quite content to die, if I can bring up and launch one hundred
such men over India. He, the Lord, knows best. Let ignorant men talk
nonsense. We neither seek aid nor avoid it &#8212; we are the servants of the
Most High. The petty attempts of small men should be beneath our
notice. Onward! Upon ages of struggle a character is built. Be not
discouraged. One word of truth can never be lost; for ages it may be
hidden under rubbish, but it will show itself sooner or later. Truth is
indestructible, virtue is indestructible, purity is indestructible.
Give me a genuine man; I do not want masses of converts. My son, hold
fast! Do not care for anybody to help you. Is not the Lord infinitely
greater than all human help? Be holy &#8212; trust in the Lord, depend on Him
always, and you are on the right track; nothing can prevail against
you. . . .</p>
<p>Let us pray, ""Lead, Kindly Light"" &#8212; a beam will come through
the dark, and a hand will be stretched forth<!--'Volume 5 Page 58'-->
to lead us. <a name=""from_east_west""></a>I always pray for you; you must pray for me. Let each one
of us pray day and night for the downtrodden millions in India who are
held fast by poverty, priestcraft, and tyranny &#8212; pray day and night for
them. I care more to preach religion to them than to the high and the
rich. I am no metaphysician, no philosopher, nay, no saint. But I am
poor, I love the poor. I see what they call the poor of this country,
and how many there are who feel for them! What an immense difference in
India! Who feels there for the two hundred millions of men and women
sunken for ever in poverty and ignorance? Where is the way out? Who
feels for them? They cannot find light or education. Who will bring the
light to them &#8212; who will travel from door to door bringing education to
them? Let these people be your God &#8212; think of them, work for them, pray
for them incessantly &#8212; the Lord will show you the way. Him I call a
Mahâtman (great soul) whose heart bleeds for the poor, otherwise he is

</body></html>",6213,"DEAR ALASINGA,

Your letter just to hand. . . . I was mistaken in asking you to publish the scraps I sent you. It was one of my awful mistakes. It shows a moment's weakness. Money can be raised in this country by lecturing for two or three years. But I have tried a little, and although there is much public appreciation of my work, it is thoroughly uncongenial and demoralising to me. . . .

I have read what you say about the Indian papers and their criticisms, which are natural. Jealousy is the central vice of every enslaved race. And it is jealousy and want of combination which cause and perpetuate slavery. You cannot feel the truth of this remark until you come out of India. The secret of Westerners' success is this power of combination, the basis of which is mutual trust and appreciation. The weaker and more cowardly a nation is, so much the more is this sin visible. . . . But, my son, you ought not to expect anything from a slavish race. The case is almost desperate no doubt, but let me put the case before you all. Can you put life into this dead mass — dead to almost all moral aspiration, deadto all future possibilities — and always ready to spring upon those that would try to do good to them? Can you take the position of a physician who tries to pour medicine down the throat of a kicking and refractory child? . . . An American or a European always supports his countrymen in a foreign country. . . . Let me remind you again, ""Thou hast the right to work but not to the fruits thereof."" Stand firm like a rock. Truth always triumphs. Let the children of Shri Ramakrishna be true to themselves and everything will be all right. We may not live to see the outcome, but as sure as we live, it will come sooner or later. What India wants is a new electric fire to stir up a fresh vigour in the national veins. This was ever, and always will be, slow work. Be content to work, and, above all, be true to yourself. Be pure, staunch, and sincere to the very backbone, and everything will be all right. If you have marked anything in the disciples of Shri Ramakrishna, it is this — they are sincere to the backbone. My task will be done, and I shall be quite content to die, if I can bring up and launch one hundred such men over India. He, the Lord, knows best. Let ignorant men talk nonsense. We neither seek aid nor avoid it — we are the servants of the Most High. The petty attempts of small men should be beneath our notice. Onward! Upon ages of struggle a character is built. Be not discouraged. One word of truth can never be lost; for ages it may be hidden under rubbish, but it will show itself sooner or later. Truth is indestructible, virtue is indestructible, purity is indestructible. Give me a genuine man; I do not want masses of converts. My son, hold fast! Do not care for anybody to help you. Is not the Lord infinitely greater than all human help? Be holy — trust in the Lord, depend on Him always, and you are on the right track; nothing can prevail against you. . . .

Let us pray, ""Lead, Kindly Light"" — a beam will come through the dark, and a hand will be stretched forthto lead us.I always pray for you; you must pray for me. Let each one of us pray day and night for the downtrodden millions in India who are held fast by poverty, priestcraft, and tyranny — pray day and night for them. I care more to preach religion to them than to the high and the rich. I am no metaphysician, no philosopher, nay, no saint. But I am poor, I love the poor. I see what they call the poor of this country, and how many there are who feel for them! What an immense difference in India! Who feels there for the two hundred millions of men and women sunken for ever in poverty and ignorance? Where is the way out? Who feels for them? They cannot find light or education. Who will bring the light to them — who will travel from door to door bringing education to them? Let these people be your God — think of them, work for them, pray for them incessantly — the Lord will show you the way. Him I call a Mahâtman (great soul) whose heart bleeds for the poor, otherwise he is a Durâtman (wicked soul). Let us unite our wills in continued prayer for their good. We may die unknown, unpitied, unbewailed, without accomplishing anything — but not one thought will be lost. It will take effect, sooner or later. My heart is too full to express my feeling; you know it, you can imagine it. So long as the millions live in hunger and ignorance, I hold every man a traitor who, having been educated at their expense, pays not the least heed to them! I call those men who strut about in their finery, having got all their money by grinding the poor, wretches, so long as they do not do anything for those two hundred millions who are now no better than hungry savages! We are poor, my brothers, we are nobodies, but such have been always the instruments of the Most High. The Lord bless you all.","With all love,

<p>DEAR DHARMAPALA, </p>
<p>I have forgotten your address in Calcutta; so I direct this to
the Math. I heard about your speeches in Calcutta and how wonderful was
the effect produced by them. A certain retired missionary here wrote me
a letter addressing me as brother and then hastily went to publish my
short answer and make a show. But you know what people here think of
such gentlemen. Moreover, the same missionary went privately to some of
my friends to ask them not to befriend me. Of course he met with
universal contempt. I am quite astonished at this man's behaviour &#8212; a
preacher of religion to take to such underhand dealings! Unfortunately
too much of that in every country and in every religion. Last winter I
travelled a good deal in this country although the weather was very
severe. I thought it would be dreadful, but I did not find it so after
all. You remember Col. Neggenson, President of the Free Religious
Society. He makes very kind inquiries about you. I met Dr. Carpenter of
Oxford (England) the other day. He delivered an address on the ethics
of Buddhism at Plymouth. It was very sympathetic and scholarly. He made
inquiries about you and your paper. Hope, your noble work will succeed.
You are a worthy servant of Him who came Bahujana Hitâya Bahujana
Sukhâya (for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many). </p>
<p>. . . <a name=""from_east_west""></a>The Christianity that is preached in India is quite
different from what one sees here; you will be astonished to hear,
Dharmapala, that I have friends in this country amongst the clergy of
the Episcopal and even Presbyterian churches, who are as broad, as
liberal, and<!--'Volume 5 Page 60'--> as sincere as you
are in your own religion. The real spiritual man is broad everywhere.
His love forces him to be so. Those to whom religion is a trade are
forced to become narrow and mischievous by their introduction into
religion of the competitive, fighting, and selfish methods of the world.</p>

<i>1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>Listen to an old story. A lazy tramp sauntering along the road
saw an old man sitting at the door of his house and stopped to inquire
of him the whereabouts of a certain place. ""How far is such and such a
village?"" he asked. The old man remained silent. The man repeated his
query several times. Still there was no answer. Disgusted at this, the
traveller turned to go away. The old man then stood up and said, ""The
village of &#8212; is only a mile from here."" ""What!"" said the tramp, ""Why
did you not speak when I asked you before?"" ""Because then"", said the
old man, ""you seemed so halting and careless about proceeding, but now
you are starting off in good earnest, and you have a right to an
answer."" </p>
<p>Will you remember this story, my son? Go to work, the rest
will come: ""Whosoever not trusting in anything else but Me, rests on
Me, I supply him with everything he needs"" (Gitâ, IX. 22). This is no
dream. </p>
<p>. . . The work should be in the line of preaching and serving,
at the present time. Choose a place of meeting where you can assemble
every week holding a service and reading the Upanishads with the
commentaries, and so slowly go on learning and working. Every<!--'Volume 5 Page 61'-->
thing will come to you if you put your shoulders to the wheel. . . </p>
<p>Now, go to work! G. G.'s nature is of the emotional type, you
have a level head; so work together; plunge in; this is only the
beginning. Every nation must save itself; we must not depend upon funds
from America for the revival of Hinduism, for that is a delusion. To
have a centre is a great thing; try to secure such a place in a large
town like Madras, end go on radiating a living force in all directions.
Begin slowly. Start with a few lay missionaries; gradually others will
come who will devote their whole lives to the work. Do not try to be a
ruler. He is the best ruler who can serve well. Be true unto death. The
work we want &#8212; we do not seek wealth, name or fame. . . . Be brave. . .
. Endeavour to interest the people of Madras in collecting funds for
the purpose, and then make a beginning. . . . Be perfectly unselfish
and you will be sure to succeed. . . . Without losing the independence
in work, show all regards to your superiors. Work in harmony. . . . My
children must be ready to jump into fire, if needed, to accomplish
their work. Now work, work, work! We will stop and compare notes later
on. Have patience, perseverance, and purity. </p>
<p>I am writing no book on Hinduism just now. I am simply jotting
down my thoughts. I do not know if I shall publish them. What is in
books? The world is too full of foolish things already. If you could
start a magazine on Vedantic lines, it would further our object. Be
positive; do not criticise others. Give your message, teach what you
have to teach, and there stop. The Lord knows the rest. . . . </p>
<p>Do not send me any more newspapers, as I do not notice the
missionary criticisms on myself; and here the public estimation of me
is better for that reason. </p>
<p>. . . If you are really my children, you will fear nothing,
stop at nothing. You will be like lions. We<!--'Volume 5 Page 62'-->
must rouse India and the whole world. No cowardice. I will take no nay.
Do you understand? Be true unto death! . . . The secret of this is
Guru-Bhakti &#8212; faith in the Guru unto death! Have you that? I believe
with all my heart that you have, and you know that I have confidence in
you &#8212; so go to work. You must succeed. My prayers and benedictions
follow every step you take. Work in harmony. Be patient with everybody.
Every one has my love. I am watching you. Onward! Onward! This is just
the beginning. My little work here makes a big echo in India, do you
know? So I shall not return there in a hurry. My intention is to do
something permanent here, and with that object I am working day by day.
I am every day gaining the confidence of the American people. . . .
Expand your hearts and hopes, as wide as the world. Study Sanskrit,
especially the three Bhâshyas (commentaries) on the Vedanta. Be ready,
for I have many plans for the future. Try to be a magnetic speaker.
Electrify the people. Everything will come to you if you have faith. So
tell Kidi, in fact, tell all my children there. In time they will do
great things at which the world will wonder. Take heart and work. Show
me something you have done. Show me a temple, a press, a paper, a home
for me. Where shall I come to if you cannot make a home for me in
Madras? Electrify people. Raise funds and preach. Be true to your
mission. Thus far you promise well, so go on and do better and better
still. </p>
<p>. . .Do not fight with people; do not antagonise anyone. Why
should we mind if Jack and John become Christians? Let them follow
whatever religion suits them. Why should you mix in controversies? Bear
with the various opinions of everybody. Patience, purity, and
perseverance will prevail.&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR G. G, (G. G. Narasimhachariar) </p>
<p>Your letter just to hand. . . . The Parliament of Religions
was organised with the intention of proving the superiority of the
Christian religion over other forms of faith, but the philosophic
religion of Hinduism was able to maintain its position notwithstanding.
Dr. Barrows and the men of that ilk are very orthodox, and I do not
look to them for help. . . . The Lord has sent me many friends in this
country, and they are always on the increase. The Lord bless those who
have tried to injure me. . . . I have been running all the time between
Boston and New York, two great centres of this country, of which Boston
may be called the brain and New York, the purse. In both, my success is
more than ordinary. I am indifferent to the newspaper reports, and you
must not expect me to send any of them to you. A little boom was
necessary to begin work. We have had more than enough of that. </p>
<p>I have written to Mani Iyer, and I have given you my
directions already. <i>Now show me what you can do</i>. No
foolish talk now, but actual work; the Hindus must back their talk with
real work; if they cannot they do not deserve anything; that is all.
America is not going to give you money for your fads. And why should
they? As for me, I want to teach the truth; I do not care whether here
or elsewhere. </p>
<p>In <a name=""from_east_west""></a>future do not pay any heed to what people say either for or
against you or me. Work on, be lions; and the Lord will bless you. I
shall work incessantly until I die, and even after death I shall work
for the good<!--'Volume 5 Page 65'--> of the world. Truth
is infinitely more weighty than untruth; so is goodness. If you possess
these, they will make their way by sheer gravity. </p>
<p>I have no connection with the Theosophists. And Judge will
help me &#8212; pooh! . . . Thousands of the best men <i>do</i>
care for me; you know this, and have faith in the Lord. I am slowly
exercising an influence in this land greater than all the newspaper
blazoning of me can do. The orthodox feel it, but they cannot help it.
It is the force of character, of purity, and of truth &#8212; of personality.
So long as I have these things, you can feel easy; no one will be able
to injure a hair of my head. If they try, they will fail, saith the
Lord. . . . Enough of books and theories. It is the<i> life</i>
that is the highest and the only way to stir the hearts of people; it
carries the personal magnetism. . . . The Lord is giving me a deeper
and deeper insight every day. Work, work, work. . . . Truce to foolish
talk; talk of the Lord. Life is too short to be spent in talking about
frauds and cranks </p>
<p>You must always remember that every nation must save itself;
so must every man; do not look to others for help. Through hard work
here, I shall be able now and then to send you a little money for your
work; but that is all. If you have to look forward to that, better stop
work. Know also that this is a grand field for my ideas, and that <a name=""from_east_west_1""></a>I do
not care whether they are Hindus or Mohammedans or Christians, but
those that love the Lord will always command my service. </p>
<p>. . . I like to work on calmly and silently, and the Lord is
always with me. Follow me, if you will, by being intensely sincere,
perfectly unselfish, and, above all, by being perfectly pure. My
blessings go with you. In this short life there is no time for the
exchange of compliments. We can compare notes and compliment each other
to our hearts' content after the battle is finished. Now, do not talk;
work, work! work! I do<!--'Volume 5 Page 66'--> not see
anything permanent you have done in India &#8212; I do not see any centre you
have made &#8212; I do not see any temple or hall you have erected &#8212; I do not
see anybody joining hands with you. There is too much talk, talk, talk!
We are great, we are great! Nonsense! We are imbeciles; that is what we
are! This hankering after name and fame and all other humbugs &#8212; what
are they to me? What do I care about them? I should like to see
hundreds coming to the Lord! Where are they? I want them, I want to see
them. You must seek them out. You only give me name and fame. Have done
with name and fame; to work, my brave men, to work! You have not caught
my fire yet &#8212; you do not understand me! You run in the old ruts of
sloth and enjoyments. Down with all sloth, down with all enjoyments
here or hereafter. Plunge into the fire and bring the people towards
the Lord. </p>
<p>That you may catch my fire, that you may be intensely sincere,
that you may die the heroes' death on the field of battle &#8212; is the
constant prayer of </p>

pin their faith on what Tom, Dick, and Harry say for or against us, but
to concentrate all their energy on work.</p>

<i>12th January, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I am sorry you still continue to send me pamphlets and
newspapers, which I have written you several times not to do. I have no
time to peruse them and take notice of them. Please send them <i>no
more</i>. I do not care a fig<!--'Volume 5 Page 67'-->
for what the missionaries or the Theosophists say about me. Let them do
as they please. The very taking notice of them will be to give them
importance. Besides, you know, the missionaries only abuse and never
argue. </p>
<p>Now know once and for all that I do not care for name or fame,
or any humbug of that type. I want to preach my ideas for the good of
the world. You have done a great work; but so far as it goes, it has
only given me name and fame. My life is more precious than spending it
in getting the admiration of the world. I have no time for such
foolery. What work have you done in the way of advancing the ideas and
organising in India? <i>None, none, none</i>! </p>
<p>An <a name=""from_east_west""></a>organisation that will teach the Hindus mutual help and
appreciation is absolutely necessary. Five thousand people attended
that meeting that was held in Calcutta, and hundreds did the same in
other places, to express an appreciation of my work here &#8212; well and
good! But if you asked them each to give an anna, would they do it? The
whole national character is one of childish dependence. They are all
ready to enjoy food if it is brought to their mouth, and even some want
it pushed down. . . . You do not deserve to live if you cannot help
yourselves. </p>
<p>I have given up at present my plan for the education of the
masses. It will come by degrees. What I now want is a band of fiery
missionaries. We must have a <i>College</i> in Madras to
teach comparative religions, Sanskrit, the different schools of
Vedanta, and some European languages; we must have a press, and papers
printed in English and in the Vernaculars. When this is done, then I
shall know that you have accomplished something. Let the nation show
that they are ready to <i>do</i>. If you cannot do
anything of the kind in India, then let me alone. I have a message to
give, let me give it to the people who appreciate it and who will work
it out. What<!--'Volume 5 Page 68'--> care I who takes it?
""He who doeth the will of my Father,"" is my own. . . . </p>
<p>My name should not be made prominent; it is my ideas that I
want to see realised. The disciples of all the prophets have always
inextricably mixed up the ideas of the Master with the <i>person</i>,
and at last killed the ideas for the <i>person</i>. The
disciples of Shri Ramakrishna must guard against doing the same thing.
Work for the <i>idea</i>, not the person. The Lord bless
you. </p>

in life, and I know that you are unmoved. The surface of the sea rises

geometrical point. Because the idea of space does occur in the soul,
therefore all that were ours, are ours, and will <i>be</i>

in finding them all in God, and ourselves in the same place. The whole
secret is, then, that your father has given up the old garment he was
wearing and is standing where he was through all eternity. Will he
manifest another such garment in this or any other world? I sincerely
pray that he may not, until he does so in full consciousness. I pray
that none may be dragged anywhither by the unseen power of his own past

<p class=""right"">54 W. 33RD STREET, N.Y., <br>
<i>1st February, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTER (Miss Mary Hale) </p>
<p>I just received your beautiful note.... Well, sometimes it is
a good discipline to be forced to work for work's sake, even to the
length of not being allowed to enjoy the fruits of one's labour.... I
am very glad of your criticisms and am not sorry at all. The other day
at Miss Thursby's I had an excited argument with a Presbyterian
gentleman, who, as usual, got very hot, angry, and abusive. However, I
was afterwards severely reprimanded by Mrs. Bull for this, as such
things hinder my work. So, it seems, is your opinion. </p>
<p>I am glad you write about it just now, because I have been
giving a good deal of thought to it. In the first place, I am not at
all sorry for these things &#8212; perhaps that may disgust you &#8212; it may. I
know full well how good it is for one's worldly prospects to be <i>sweet</i>.
I do everything to be <i>sweet</i>, but when it comes to a
horrible compromise with the truth within, then I stop. I do not
believe in humility. I believe in <i>Samadarshitva </i>&#8212;
same state of mind with regard to all. The duty of the ordinary man is
to obey the commands of his ""God"", society; but the children of light
never do so. This is an eternal law. One accommodates himself to
surroundings and social opinion and gets all good things from society,
the<!--'Volume 5 Page 71'--> giver of all good to such.
The other stands alone and draws society up towards him. The
accommodating man finds a path of roses; the non-accommodating, one of
thorns. But the worshippers of ""Vox populi"" go to annihilation in a
moment; the children of truth <i>live for ever</i>. </p>
<p>I will compare truth to a corrosive substance of infinite
power. It burns its way in wherever it falls &#8212; in soft substance at
once, hard granite slowly, but it must. What is writ is writ. I am so,
so sorry, Sister, that I cannot make myself sweet and accommodating to
every black falsehood. But I cannot. I have suffered for it all my
life. But I cannot. I have essayed and essayed. But I cannot. At last I
have given it up. The Lord is great. He will not allow me to become a
hypocrite. Now let what is in come out. I have not found a way that
will please all, and I cannot but be what I am, true to my own self.
""Youth and beauty vanish, life and wealth vanish, name and fame vanish,
even the mountains crumble into dust. Friendship and love vanish. Truth
alone abides."" God of Truth, be Thou alone my guide! I am too old to
change now into milk and honey. Allow me to remain as I am. ""Without
fear &#8212; without shopkeeping, caring neither for friend nor foe, do thou
hold on to Truth, Sannyâsin, and from this moment give up this world
and the next and all that are to come &#8212; their enjoyments and their
vanities. Truth, be thou alone my guide."" I have no desire for wealth
or name or fame or enjoyments, Sister &#8212; they are dust unto me. I wanted
to help my brethren. I have not the <i>tact to earn money</i>,
bless the Lord. What reason is there for me to conform to the vagaries
of the world around me and not obey the voice of Truth within? The mind
is still weak, Sister, it sometimes mechanically clutches at earthly
help. But I am not afraid. Fear is the greatest sin my religion
teaches. </p>
<p>The last fight with the Presbyterian priest and the<!--'Volume 5 Page 72'-->
long fight afterwards with Mrs. Bull showed me in a clear light what
Manu says to the Sannyasin, ""Live alone, walk alone."" All friendship,
all love, is only limitation. There never was a friendship, especially
of women, which was not exacting. O great sages! You were right. One
cannot serve the God of Truth who leans upon somebody. Be still, my
soul! Be alone! and the Lord is with you. Life is nothing! Death is a
delusion! All this is not, God alone is! Fear not, my soul! Be alone.
Sister, the way is long, the time is short, evening is approaching. I
have to go home soon. I have no time to give my manners a finish. I
cannot find time to deliver my message. You are good, you are so kind,
I will do anything for you; and do not be angry, I see you all are mere
children. </p>
<p>Dream no more! Oh, dream no more, my soul! In one word, I have
a message to give, I have no time to be sweet to the world, and every
attempt at sweetness makes me a hypocrite. I will die a thousand deaths
rather than lead a jelly-fish existence and yield to every requirement
of this foolish world, no matter whether it be my own country or a
foreign country. You are mistaken, utterly mistaken, if you think I
have a <i>work</i>, as Mrs. Bull thinks; I have no <i>work</i>
under or beyond the sun. I have a message, and I will give it after my
own fashion. I will neither Hinduise my message, nor Christianise it,
nor make it any ""ise"" in the world. I will only my-ise it and that is
all. <i>Liberty</i>, Mukti, is all my religion, and
everything that tries to curb it, I will avoid by fight or flight.
Pooh! I try to pacify the priests!! Sister, do not take this amiss. But
you are babies and babies must submit to be taught. You have not yet
drunk of that fountain which makes ""reason unreason, mortal immortal,
this world a zero, and of man a God"". Come out if you can of this
network of foolishness they call this <i>world</i>. Then I
will call you indeed brave and free. If you cannot, cheer those that
dare dash this false God, society,<!--'Volume 5 Page 73'-->
to the ground and trample on its unmitigated hypocrisy; if you cannot
cheer them, pray, be silent, but do not try to drag them down again
into the mire with such false nonsense as <i>compromise</i>
and becoming nice and sweet. </p>
<p>I hate this world, this dream, this horrible nightmare with
its churches and chicaneries, its books and blackguardisms, its fair
faces and false hearts, its howling righteousness on the surface and
utter hollowness beneath, and, above all, its sanctified shopkeeping.
What! measure any soul according to what the bond-slaves of the world
say? &#8212; Pooh! Sister, you do not know the Sannyasin. ""He stands on the
heads of the Vedas!"" say the Vedas, because he is free from churches
and sects and religions and prophets and books and all of that ilk!
Missionary or no missionary, let them howl and attack me with all they
can, I take them as Bhartrihari says, ""Go thou thy ways, Sannyasin!
Some will say, 'Who is this mad man?' Others, 'Who is this Chandâla?'
Others will know thee to be a sage. Be glad at the prattle of the
worldlings."" But when they attack, know that, ''The elephant passing

I just received your beautiful note.... Well, sometimes it is a good discipline to be forced to work for work's sake, even to the length of not being allowed to enjoy the fruits of one's labour.... I am very glad of your criticisms and am not sorry at all. The other day at Miss Thursby's I had an excited argument with a Presbyterian gentleman, who, as usual, got very hot, angry, and abusive. However, I was afterwards severely reprimanded by Mrs. Bull for this, as such things hinder my work. So, it seems, is your opinion.

I am glad you write about it just now, because I have been giving a good deal of thought to it. In the first place, I am not at all sorry for these things — perhaps that may disgust you — it may. I know full well how good it is for one's worldly prospects to besweet. I do everything to besweet, but when it comes to a horrible compromise with the truth within, then I stop. I do not believe in humility. I believe inSamadarshitva— same state of mind with regard to all. The duty of the ordinary man is to obey the commands of his ""God"", society; but the children of light never do so. This is an eternal law. One accommodates himself to surroundings and social opinion and gets all good things from society, thegiver of all good to such. The other stands alone and draws society up towards him. The accommodating man finds a path of roses; the non-accommodating, one of thorns. But the worshippers of ""Vox populi"" go to annihilation in a moment; the children of truthlive for ever.

<p>DEAR SISTER (Isabelle McKindley) </p>
<p>Your kind note gave me pleasure inexpressible. I was also able
to read it through very easily. I have at last hit upon the orange and
have got a coat, but could<!--'Volume 5 Page 76'--> not as
yet get any in summer material. If you get any, kindly inform me. I
will have it made here in New York. Your wonderful Dearborn Ave. misfit
tailor is too much even for a <i>monk</i>. </p>
<p>Sister Locke writes me a long letter and perhaps wondering at
my delay in reply. She is apt to be carried away by enthusiasm; so I am
waiting, and again I do not know what to answer. Kindly tell her from
me that it is impossible for me to fix any place just now. Mrs. Peake
though noble, grand, and very spiritual, is as much clever in worldly
matter as I, yet I am getting cleverer every day. Mrs. Peake has been
offered, by some one whom she knows only hazily in Washington, a place
for summer. </p>
<p>Who knows that she will not be played upon? This is a
wonderful country for cheating, and 99.9 per cent have some <i>motive</i>
in the background to take advantage of others. If any one just but
closes his eyes for a moment, he is <i>gone</i>!! Sister
Josephine is fiery. Mrs. Peake is a simple good woman. I have been so
well handled by the people here that I look round me for hours before I
take a step. Everything will come to right. Ask Sister Josephine to
have a little patience. </p>
<p>You are every day finding kindergarten better than running an
old man's home I am sure. You saw Mrs. Bull, and I am sure you were
quite surprised to find her so tame and gentle. Do you see Mrs. Adams
now and then? Mrs. Bull has been greatly benefited by her lessons. I
also took a few, but no use; the ever increasing load in front does not
allow me to bend forward as Mrs. Adams wants it. If I try to bend
forward in walking, the centre of gravity comes to the surface of the
stomach, and so I go cutting front somersaults. </p>
<p>No millionaire coming? Not even a few hundred thousands?
Sorry, very sorry!!! I am trying my best; what I can do? My classes are
full of women. You of<!--'Volume 5 Page 77'--> course
cannot marry a woman. Well, have patience. I will keep my eyes open and
never let go an opportunity. If you do not get one, it would not be
owing to any laziness at least on my part. </p>
<p>Life goes on the same old ruts. Sometimes I get disgusted with
eternal lecturings and talkings, want to be silent for days and days. </p>

happy). </p>

Mrs. Peake though noble, grand, and very spiritual, is as much clever in worldly matter as I, yet I am getting cleverer every day. Mrs. Peake has been offered, by some one whom she knows only hazily in Washington, a place for summer.

Who knows that she will not be played upon? This is a wonderful country for cheating, and 99.9 per cent have somemotivein the background to take advantage of others. If any one just but closes his eyes for a moment, he isgone!! Sister Josephine is fiery. Mrs. Peake is a simple good woman. I have been so well handled by the people here that I look round me for hours before I take a step. Everything will come to right. Ask Sister Josephine to have a little patience.

You are every day finding kindergarten better than running an old man's home I am sure. You saw Mrs. Bull, and I am sure you were quite surprised to find her so tame and gentle. Do you see Mrs. Adams now and then? Mrs. Bull has been greatly benefited by her lessons. I also took a few, but no use; the ever increasing load in front does not allow me to bend forward as Mrs. Adams wants it. If I try to bend forward in walking, the centre of gravity comes to the surface of the stomach, and so I go cutting front somersaults.

No millionaire coming? Not even a few hundred thousands? Sorry, very sorry!!! I am trying my best; what I can do? My classes are full of women. You ofcourse cannot marry a woman. Well, have patience. I will keep my eyes open and never let go an opportunity. If you do not get one, it would not be owing to any laziness at least on my part.

Life goes on the same old ruts. Sometimes I get disgusted with eternal lecturings and talkings, want to be silent for days and days.

Hoping you the best dreams (for that is the only way to be happy).","I remain ever your loving bro.,

This country takes kindly to my ideas. I will go back when I get the
Command. In the meanwhile, do you all gently and patiently work. If
anybody attacks me, simply ignore his existence. . . . My idea is for
you to start a Society where people could be taught the Vedas and the

<h2>XXXIX</h2>
<p class=""right"">U. S. A., <br>
<i>6th May, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>This morning I received your last letter and that first volume
of the Bhâshya of Râmânujâcharya. A few days ago I received another
letter from you. Also I received a letter from Mr. Mani Iyer. I am
doing well and going on in the same old rate. You mention about the
lectures of Mr. Lund. I do not know who he is or where he is. He may be
some one lecturing in Churches; for had he big platforms, we would have
heard of him. Maybe, he gets them reported in some newspapers and sends
them to India; and the missionaries may be making trade out of it.
Well, so far I guess from the tone of your letters. It is no public
affair here to call forth any defence from us; for in that case I will
have to fight hundreds of them here every day. For India is now in the
air, and the orthodox, including Dr. Barrows and all the rest, are
struggling hard to put out the fire. In the second place, every one of
these orthodox lectures against India must have a good deal of abuse
hurled against me. If you hear some of the filthy stories the orthodox
men and women invent against me, you will be astonished. Now, do you
mean to say that a Sannyâsin should go about defending himself against
the brutal and cowardly<!--'Volume 5 Page 80'--> attacks
of these self-seeking men and women? I have some very influential
friends here who, now and then, give them their quietus. Again, why
should I waste my energies defending Hinduism if the Hindus all go to
sleep? What are you three hundred millions of people doing there,
especially those that are so proud of their learning etc.? Why do you
not take up the fighting and leave me to teach and preach? Here am I
struggling day and night in the midst of strangers.... What help does
India send? Did the world ever see a nation with less patriotism than
the Indian? If you could send and maintain for a few years a dozen
well-educated strong men to preach in Europe and America, you would do
immense service to India, both morally and politically. Every man who
morally sympathises with India becomes a political friend. Many of the
Western people think of you as a nation of half-naked savages, and
therefore only fit to be whipped into civilization. If you three
hundred millions become cowed by the missionaries &#8212; you cowards &#8212; and
dare not say a word, what can one man do in a far distant land? Even
what I have done, you do not deserve. </p>
<p>Why do you not send your defences to the American magazines?
What prevents you? You race of cowards &#8212; physical, moral, and
spiritual! You animals fit to be treated as you are with two ideas
before you &#8212; lust and money &#8212; you want to prod a Sannyasin to a life of
constant fighting, and you are afraid of the ""Saheb logs"", even
missionaries! And you will do great things, pish! Why not some of you
write a beautiful defence and send it to the Arena Publishing Company
of Boston? The <i>Arena</i> is a magazine which will
gladly publish it and perhaps pay you hard money. So far it ends. Think
of this when you will be tempted to be a fool. Think that up to date
every blackguard of a Hindu that had hitherto come to western lands had
too often criticised his own faith and country<!--'Volume 5 Page 81'-->
in order to get praise or money. You know that I did not come to seek
name and fame; it was forced upon me. Why shall I go back to India? Who
will help me? . . . You are children, you prattle you do not know what.
Where are the men in Madras who will give up the world to preach
religion? Worldliness and realization of God cannot go together. I am
the one man who dared defend his country, and I have given them such
ideas as they never expected from a Hindu. There are many who are
against me, but I will never be a coward like you. There are also
thousands in the country who are my friends, and hundreds who would
follow me unto death; every year they will increase, and if I live and
work with them, my ideals of life and religion will be fulfilled. Do
you see? </p>
<p>I do not hear much now about the Temple Universal that was to
be built in America; yet I have a firm footing in New York, the very
centre of American life, and so my work will go on. I am taking several
of my disciples to a summer retreat to finish their training in Yoga
and Bhakti and Jnâna, and then they will be able to help carry the work
on. Now my boys, go to work. </p>
<p>Within a month I shall be in a position to send some money for
the paper. Do not go about begging from the Hindu beggars. I will do it
all <i>myself</i> with my own brain and strong right hand.
I do not want the help of any man here or in India. . . . Do not press
too much the Ramakrishna Avatâra. </p>
<p>Now <a name=""from_east_west""></a>I will tell you my discovery. All of religion is contained
in the Vedanta, that is, in the three stages of the Vedanta philosophy,
the Dvaita, Vishishtâdvaita and Advaita; one comes after the other.
These are the three stages of spiritual growth in man. Each one is
necessary. This is the essential of religion: the Vedanta, applied to
the various ethnic customs and creeds of India, is Hinduism. The first
stage, i.e. Dvaita, applied to the ideas of the ethnic groups of
Europe, is Christianity;<!--'Volume 5 Page 82'--> as
applied to the Semitic groups, Mohammedanism. The Advaita, as applied
in its Yoga-perception form, is Buddhism etc. Now by religion is meant
the Vedanta; the applications must vary according to the different
needs, surroundings, and other circumstances of different nations. You
will find that although the philosophy is the same, the Shâktas,
Shaivas, etc. apply it each to their own special cult and <i>forms</i>.
Now, in your journal write article after article on these three
systems, showing their harmony as one following after the other, and at
the same time keeping off the ceremonial forms altogether. That is,
preach the philosophy, the spiritual part, and let people suit it to
their own forms. I wish to write a book on this subject, therefore I
wanted the three Bhashyas; but only one volume of the Ramanuja
(Bhashya) has reached me as yet. </p>
<p>The American Theosophists have seceded from the others, and
now they hate India. Poor things! And Sturdy of England who has lately
been in India and met my brother Shivananda wrote me a letter wanting
to know when I go over to England. I wrote him a nice letter. What
about Babu Akshay Kumar Ghosh? I do not hear anything from him more.
Give the missionaries and others their dues. Get up some of our very
strong men and write a nice, strong, but good-toned article on the
present religious revival in India and send it to some American
magazine. I am acquainted with only one or two of them. You know I am
not much of a writer. I am not in the habit of going from door to door
begging. I sit quiet and let things come to me. . . . Now, my children,
I could have made a grand success in the way of organising here, if I
were a worldly hypocrite. Alas! That is all of religion here; money and
name = priest, money and lust = layman. I am to create a new order of
humanity here who are sincere believers in God and care nothing for the
world. This must be slow, very<!--'Volume 5 Page 83'-->
slow. In the meantime you go on with your work, and I shall steer my
boat straight ahead. The journal must not be flippant but steady, calm,
and high-toned. . . . Get hold of a band of fine, steady writers. . . .
Be perfectly unselfish, be steady and work on. We will do great things;
do not fear. . . . One thing more. Be the servant of all, and do not
try in the least to govern others. That will excite jealousy and
destroy everything. . . . Go on. You have worked wonderfully well. We
do not wait for help, we will work it out, my boy, be self-reliant,
faithful and patient. Do not antagonise my other friends, live in
harmony with all. My eternal love to all. </p>
<p class=""right"">Ever yours with blessings, </p>

<p>PS. Nobody will come to help you if you put yourself forward
as a leader. . . . Kill self first if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>. . . Now I have got a hold on New York, and I hope to get a
permanent body of workers who will carry on the work when I leave the
country. Do you see, my boy, all this newspaper blazoning is nothing? I
ought to be able to leave a permanent effect behind me when I go; and
with the blessings of the Lord it is going to be very soon. . . . <i>Men</i>
are more valuable than all the wealth of the world. </p>

My coming to this country and all my labours must not be in vain. </p>
<p>The Lord is merciful, and although there are many who try to
injure me any way they can, there are many also who will befriend me to
the last. Infinite patience, infinite purity, and infinite perseverance
are the secret of success in a good cause. </p>

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I received your missionary book and the Ramnad photos. I have
written to the Raja as well as the Dewan at Mysore. The missionary
pamphlet must have reached here long ago, as the Ramabai circle
controversy with Dr. Janes savoured of it, it seems. Now you need not
be afraid of anything. There is one misstatement in that pamphlet. I
never went to a big hotel in this country, and very few times to any
other. At Baltimore, the small hotels, being ignorant, would not take
in a black man, thinking him a negro. So my host, Dr. Vrooman, had to
take me to a larger one, because they knew the difference<!--'Volume 5 Page 86'-->
between a negro and a foreigner. Let me tell you, Alasinga, that you
have to defend yourselves. Why do you behave like babies? If anybody
attacks your religion, why cannot, you defend it? As for me, you need
not be afraid, I have more friends than enemies here, and in this
country one-third are Christians, and only a small number of the
educated care about the missionaries. Again, the very fact of the
missionaries being against anything makes the educated like it. They
are less of a power here now, and are becoming less so every day. If
their attacks pain you, why do you behave like a petulant child and
refer to me? . . . Cowardice is no virtue. </p>
<p>Here I have already got a respectable following. Next year I
will organise it on a working basis, and then the work will be carried
on. And when I am off to India, I have friends who will back me here
and help me in India too; so you need not fear. So long as you shriek
at the missionary attempts and jump without being able to do anything,
I laugh at you; you are little dollies, that is what you are. . . .
What can Swami do for old babies!! </p>
<p>I know, my son, I shall have to come and manufacture men out
of you. I know that India is only inhabited by women and eunuchs. So do
not fret. I will have to get means to work there. I do not put myself
in the hands of imbeciles. You need not worry, do what little you can.
I have to work alone from top to bottom. . . . ""This Âtman (Self) is
not to be reached by cowards."" You need not be afraid for me. The Lord
is with me, you defend yourselves only and show me you can do that; and
I will be satisfied. Don't bother me any more with what any one says
about me. I am not waiting to hear any fool's judgment of me. You
babies, great results are attained only by great patience, great
courage, and great attempts. . . . Kidi's mind is taking periodic
somersaults, I am afraid. . . . </p>
<p>The brave alone do great things, not the cowards.<!--'Volume 5 Page 87'-->

Lord. So long as I am pure and His servant, not a hair of my head will
be touched. . . . Do something for the nation, then they will help you,

morning after breakfast. The meals are being conducted on the strictest
vegetarian principles, and I am fasting a good deal. </p>
<p>I am determined that several pounds of my fat shall be off
before I leave. This is a Methodist place, and<!--'Volume 5 Page 89'-->

<p>I will always look back upon the delightful time I had at

<p>I am in a sort of sleepy, lazy, happy state now and do not
seem to dislike it. Marie Louise brought a little tortoise from New
York, her pet. Now, arriving here, the pet found himself surrounded
with his natural element. So by dint of persistent tumbling and
crawling, he has left the love and fondlings of Marie Louise far, far
behind. She was a little sorry at first, but we preached liberty with
such a vigour that she had to come round quick </p>

Now, arriving here, the pet found himself surrounded with his natural element. So by dint of persistent tumbling and crawling, he has left the love and fondlings of Marie Louise far, far behind. She was a little sorry at first, but we preached liberty with such a vigour that she had to come round quick

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>. . . I am surprised you take so seriously the missionaries'
nonsense. . . . If the people in India want me to keep strictly to my
Hindu diet, please tell them to send me a cook and money enough to keep
him. This silly <i>bossism</i> without a mite of real help
makes me laugh. On the other hand, if the missionaries tell you that I
have ever broken the two great vows of the Sannyâsin &#8212; chastity and
poverty &#8212; tell them that they are <i>big liars</i>. Please
write to the missionary Hume asking him categorically to write you what
misdemeanour he saw in me, or give you the names of his informants, and
whether the information was <i>first-hand or not</i>; that
will settle the question and expose the whole thing. . . . </p>
<p>As for me, mind you, I stand at nobody's dictation. I know my
mission in life, and no chauvinism about me; I belong as much to India
as to the world, no humbug about that. I have helped you all I could.
You must now help yourselves. What country has any special claim on me?
Am I any nation's slave? Don't talk any more silly nonsense, you
faithless atheists. </p>
<p>I have worked hard and sent all the money I got to Calcutta
and Madras, and then after doing all this, stand their silly dictation!
Are you not ashamed? What do I owe to them? Do I care a fig for their
praise or fear their blame? I am a singular man, my son, not even you<!--'Volume 5 Page 96'-->
can understand me yet. Do your work; if you cannot, stop; but do not
try to ""boss"" me with your nonsense. I <i>see</i> a
greater Power than man, or God, or devil at my back. I require nobody's
help. I have been all my life helping others. . . . They cannot raise a
few rupees to help the work of the greatest man their country ever
produced &#8212; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa; and they talk nonsense and want to
dictate to the man for whom they did nothing, find who did everything
he could for them! Such is the ungrateful world! </p>
<p>Do you mean to say I am born to live and die one of those
caste-ridden, superstitious, merciless, hypocritical, atheistic <i>cowards</i>
that you find only amongst the educated Hindus? I hate cowardice; I
will have nothing to do with cowards or political nonsense. I do not
believe in any politics. God and truth are the only politics in the
world, everything else is trash. </p>

myself at it. The English people do not: talk much in the newspapers,
but they work silently. I am sure of more work in England than in
America. Bands and bands come, and I have no room for so many; so they
squat on the floor, ladies and all. I tell them to imagine that they
are under the sky of India, under a spreading banyan, and they like the
idea. I shall have to go away next week, and they are so sorry. Some
think my work here will be hurt a little if I go away so soon. I do not
think so. I do not depend on men or things. The Lord alone I depend
upon &#8212; and He works through me. </p>

purity, and whatever obstructions may now be in your way, the world is

<i>13th February, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>BLESSED AND BELOVED, (E. T. Sturdy) </p>
<p>About the Sannyâsin coming over from India, I am sure he will
help you in the translation work, also in other work. Later on, when I
come, I may send him over to America. Today another Sannyasin has been
added to the list. This time it is a man who is a genuine American and
a religious teacher of some standing in the country. He was Dr. Street.
He is now Yogananda, as his leaning is all towards Yoga. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 101'-->
<p>I have been sending regular reports to the <i>Brahmavâdin</i>
from here. They will be published soon. It takes such a long time for
things to reach India! Things are growing nobly in India. As there was
no hocus-pocus from the beginning, the Vedanta is drawing the attention
of the highest classes in American society. Sarah Bernhardt, the French
actress, has been playing ""Iziel"" here. It is a sort of Frenchified
life of Buddha, where a courtesan ""Iziel"" wants to seduce the Buddha,
under the banyan&nbsp;&#8212; and the Buddha preaches to her the vanity of the
world, whilst she is sitting all the time in Buddha's lap. However, all
is well that ends well &#8212; the courtesan fails. Madame Bernhardt acts the
courtesan. I went to see the Buddha business &#8212; and Madame spying me in
the audience wanted to have an interview with me. A swell family of my
acquaintance arranged the affair. There were besides Madame M. Morrel,
the celebrated singer, also the great electrician Tesla. Madame is a
very scholarly lady and has studied up the metaphysics a good deal. M.
Morrel was being interested, but Mr. Tesla was charmed to hear about
the Vedantic Prâna and Âkâsha and the Kalpas, which according to him
are the only theories modern science can entertain. Now both Akasha and
Prana again are produced from the cosmic Mahat, the Universal Mind, the
Brahmâ or Ishvara. Mr. Tesla thinks he can demonstrate mathematically
that force and matter are reducible to potential energy. I am to go and
see him next week, to get this new mathematical demonstration. </p>
<p>In that case, the Vedantic cosmology will be placed on the
surest of foundations. I am working a good deal now upon the cosmology
and eschatology (That is, doctrine of the last things &#8212; death,
judgement, etc.) of the Vedanta. I clearly see their perfect unison
with modern science, and the elucidation of the one will be followed by
that<!--'Volume 5 Page 102'--> of the other. I intend to
write a book later on in the form of questions and answers. (This was
never done. But from his lectures in London in 1896, it is easy to see
that his mind was still working on these ideas. (See also Vol. VIII <a href=""../../volume_8/sayings_and_utterances.htm#v5_epi_057"">Sayings
and Utterances</a><!--'Volume 5 Page 102'-->
&amp; <a href=""../../volume_8/epistles_fourth_series/068_blessed_and_beloved.htm"">Letter
to Mr. Sturdy</a><!--'Volume 5 Page 102'--> .)). The
first chapter will be on cosmology, showing the harmony between
Vedantic theories and modern science. <br>
<img src=""057_diagram.jpg"" align=""left"" height=""140"" width=""319""><br>
The eschatology will be explained from the Advaitic standpoint only.
That is to say, the dualist claims that the soul after death passes on
to the Solar sphere, thence to the Lunar sphere, thence to the Electric
sphere. Thence he is accompanied by a Purusha to Brahmaloka. (Thence,
says the Advaitist, he goes to Nirvâna.) </p>
<p>Now on the Advaitic side, it is held that the soul neither
comes nor goes, and that all these spheres or layers of the universe
are only so many varying products of Akasha and Prana. That is to say,
the lowest or most condensed is the Solar sphere, consisting of the
visible universe, in which Prana appears as physical force, and Akasha
as sensible matter. The next is called the Lunar sphere, which
surrounds the Solar sphere. This is not the moon at all, but the
habitation of the gods, that is to say, Prana appears in it as psychic
forces, and Akasha as Tanmâtras or fine particles. Beyond this is the
Electric sphere, that is to say, a condition in which the Prana is
almost inseparable from Akasha, and you can hardly tell whether
Electricity is force or matter. Next is the Brahmaloka. where there is
neither Prana nor Akasha, but both are merged in the <i>mind
stuff</i>, the primal energy. And here &#8212; there big neither Prana
nor Akasha &#8212; the Jiva<!--'Volume 5 Page 103'-->
contemplates the whole universe as Samashti or the sum total of Mahat
or mind. This appears as a Purusha, an abstract universal <i>soul</i>,
yet not the Absolute, for still there is multiplicity. From this the
Jiva finds at last that Unity which is the end. Advaitism says that
these are the visions which rise in succession before the Jiva, who
himself neither goes nor comes, and that in the same way this present
vision has been projected. The projection (Srishti) and dissolution
must take place in the same order, only one means going backward, and
the other coming out. </p>
<p>Now as each individual can only see <i>his own</i>
universe, that universe is created with his bondage and goes away with
his liberation, although it remains for others who are in bondage. Now
name and form constitute the universe. A wave in the ocean is a wave,
only in so far as it is bound by name and form. If the wave subsides,
it is the ocean, but those name and form have immediately vanished for
ever. So though the name and form of wave could never be without <i>water</i>
that was fashioned into the wave by them, yet the name and form
themselves were not the wave. They die as soon as ever it returns to
water. But other names and forms live in relation to other waves. This
name-and-form is called Mâyâ, and the water is Brahman. The wave was
nothing but water all the time, yet as a wave it had the name and form.
Again this name and form cannot remain for one moment separated from
the wave, although the <i>wave</i> as water can remain
eternally separate from name and form. But because the name and form
can never he <i>separated</i>, they can never be said to <i>exist</i>.
Yet they are not <i>zero</i>. This is called Maya. </p>
<p>I want to work; all this out carefully, but you will see at a
glance that I am on the right track. It will take more study in
physiology, on the relations between the higher and lower centres, to
fill out the psychology of mind Chitta (mind-stuff), and Buddhi
(intellect), and so<!--'Volume 5 Page 104'--> on. But I
have clear light now, free of all hocus-pocus. I want to give them dry,
hard reason, softened in the sweetest syrup of love and made spicy
with intense work, and cooked in the kitchen of Yoga, so that even a
baby can easily digest it. </p>

<i>17th February, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>. . . I have used some very harsh words in my letters, which
you ought to excuse, as you know, I get nervous at times. The work is
terribly hard; and the more it is growing, the harder it is becoming. I
need a long rest very badly. Yet a great work is before me in England. </p>
<p>Have patience, my son &#8212; it will grow beyond all your
expectations. . . . Every work has got to pass through hundreds of
difficulties before succeeding. Those that persevere will see the
light, sooner or later. </p>
<p>I have succeeded now in rousing the very heart of the American
civilisation, New York, but it has been a terrific struggle. . . . I
have spent nearly, all I had on this New York work and in England. Now
things are in such a shape that they will go on. Just as I am writing
to you, every one of my bones is paining after last afternoon's long
Sunday public lecture. Then you see, to put the Hindu ideas into
English and then make out of dry philosophy and intricate mythology and
queer startling psychology, a religion which shall be easy, simple,
popular, and at the same time meet the requirements of the highest
minds &#8212; is a task only those can understand who have attempted it. The
dry, abstract Advaita must become living &#8212; poetic &#8212; in everyday life;
out of hopelessly intricate mythology<!--'Volume 5 Page 105'-->
must come concrete moral forms; and out of bewildering Yogi-ism must
come the most scientific and practical psychology &#8212; and all this must
be put in a form so that a child may grasp it. That is my life's work.
The Lord only knows how far I shall succeed. ""To work we have the
right, not to the fruits thereof."" It is hard work, my boy, hard work!
To keep one's self steady in the midst of this whirl of Kâma-Kânchana
(lust and gold) and hold on to one's own ideals, until disciples are
moulded to conceive of the ideas of realisation and perfect
renunciation, is indeed difficult work, my boy. Thank God, already
there is great success. I cannot blame the missionaries and others for
not understanding me &#8212; they hardly ever saw a man who did not care in
the least about women and money. At first they could not believe it to
be possible; how could they? You must not think that the Western
nations have the same ideas of chastity and purity as the Indians.
Their equivalents are virtue and courage. . . . People are now flocking
to me. Hundreds have now become convinced that there are men who can
really control their bodily desires; and reverence and respect for
these principles are growing. All things come to him who waits. May you
be blessed for ever and ever!</p>

<p class=""right"">NEW YORK, <br>
<i>14th April, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,</p>
<p>I received your note this morning. As I am sailing for England
tomorrow, I can only write a few hearty lines. I have every sympathy
with your proposed magazine for boys, and will do my best to help it
on. You ought to make it independent, following the same lines as the <i>Brahmavâdin</i>,
only making the style and matter much more popular. As for example,
there is a great chance, much more than you ever dream of, for those
wonderful stories scattered all over the Sanskrit literature, to be
re-written and made popular. That should be the one great feature of
your journal. I will write stories, as many as I can, when time
permits. Avoid all attempts to make the journal scholarly &#8212; the <i>Brahmavadin</i>
stands for that &#8212; and it will slowly make its way all over the world, I
am sure. Use the simplest language possible, and you will succeed. The
main feature should be the teaching of principles through stories.
Don't make it metaphysical at all. As to the business part, keep it
wholly in your hands. ""Too many cooks spoil the broth."" In India the
one thing we lack is the power of combination, organisation, the first
secret of which is obedience. </p>
<p>I have also promised to help starting a magazine in Bengali in
Calcutta. Only the first year I used to charge<!--'Volume 5 Page 108'-->
for my lectures. The last two years, my work was entirely free of all
charges. As such, I have almost no money to send you or the Calcutta
people. But I will get people to help you with funds very soon. Go on
bravely. Do not expect success in a day or a year. Always hold on to
the highest. Be steady. Avoid jealousy and selfishness. Be obedient and
eternally faithful to the cause of truth, humanity, and your country,
and you will move the world. Remember it is the <i>person</i>,
the life, which is the secret of power &#8212; nothing else. Keep this letter
and read the last lines whenever you feel worried or jealous. Jealousy
is the bane of all slaves. It is the bane of our nation. Avoid that
always. All blessings attend you and all success. </p>

<i>14th July, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DR. NANJUNDA RAO,</p>
<p>The numbers of <i>Prabuddha Bharata</i> have been
received and distributed too to the class. It is very satisfactory. It
will have a great sale, no doubt, in India. In America I may get also a
number of subscribers. I have already arranged for advertising it in
America and Goodyear has done it already. But here in England the
progress will be slower indeed. The great drawback here is &#8212; they all
want to start papers of their own; and it is right that it should be
so, seeing that, after all, no foreigner will ever write the English
language as well as the native Englishman, end the ideas, when put in
good English, will spread farther than in Hindu English. Then again it
is much more difficult to write a story in a foreign<!--'Volume 5 Page 109'-->
language than an essay. I am trying my best to get you subscribers
here. But you must not depend on any <i>foreign help</i>.
Nations, like individuals, must help themselves. This is real
patriotism. If a nation cannot do that, its time has not yet come. It
must wait. It is from Madras that the new light <i>must</i>
spread all over India. With this end you must stork. One point I will
remark however. The cover is simply barbarous. It is awful and hideous.
If it is possible, change it. Make it symbolical and simple, without
human figures at all. The banyan tree does not mean awakening, nor does
the hill, nor the saint, nor the European couple. The lotus is a symbol
of regeneration. </p>
<p>We are awfully behindhand in art especially in that of
painting. For instance, make a small scene of spring re-awakening in a
forest, showing how the leaves and buds are coming again. Slowly go on,
there are hundreds of ideas to be put forward. You see the symbol I
made for the <i>Raja-Yoga</i>, printed by Longman Green
and Co. You can get it at Bombay. It consists of my lectures on
Raja-Yoga in New York. </p>
<p>I am going to Switzerland next Sunday, and shall return to
London in the autumn, and take up the work again. . . . I want rest

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>Since writing to you a few days ago I have found my way to let
you know that I am in a position to do this for the <i>Brahmavadin</i>.
I will give you Rs. 100 a month for a year or two, i.e. £60 or £70 a
year, i.e. as much as would cover Rs. 100 a month. That will set you
free to work for the <i>Brahmavadin</i> and make it a
better success. Mr. Mani Iyer and a few friends can help in raising
fund that would cover the printing etc. What is the income from
subscription? Can these be employed to pay the contributors and get a
fine series of articles? It is not necessary that everybody should
understand all that is written in the <i>Brahmavadin</i>,
but that they must subscribe from patriotism and good Karma &#8212; the
Hindus I mean. </p>
<p>Several things are necessary. First there should be strict
integrity. Not that I even hint that any of you would digress from it,
but the Hindus have a peculiar slovenliness in business matters, not
being sufficiently methodical and strict in keeping accounts etc. </p>
<p>Secondly, entire devotion to the cause, knowing that your
SALVATION depends upon making the <i>Brahmavadin</i> a
success. Let this paper be your Ishtadevata, and then you will see how
success comes. I have already sent for Abhedânanda from India. I hope
there will be no delay with him as it was with the other Swami. On
receipt of this letter you send me a clear account of all the income
and the expenses of the <i>Brahmavadin</i> so that I may
judge from it what best can be done. Remember that perfect purity,
disinterestedness, and obedience to the Guru are the secret of all
success. . . . </p>
<p>A big foreign circulation of a religious paper is<!--'Volume 5 Page 112'-->
impossible. It must be supported by the Hindus if they have any sense
of virtue or gratitude left to them. </p>
<p>By the by, Mrs. Annie Besant invited me to speak at her Lodge,
on Bhakti. I lectured there one night. Col. Olcott also was there. I
did it to show my sympathy for all sects. . . . Our countrymen must
remember that in things of the Spirit we are the teachers, and not
foreigners &#8212; but in things of the world we ought to learn from them. </p>
<p>I have read Max Müller's article, which is a good one,
considering that when he wrote it, six months ago, he had no material
except Mazoomdar's leaflet. Now he writes me a long and nice letter
offering to write a book on Shri Ramakrishna. I have already supplied
him with much material, but a good deal more is needed from India. </p>

<p>Today I received a letter from India written by Abhedânanda
that in all probability he had started on the 11th August by the
B.I.S.N., ""S.S.Mombassa"". He could not get an earlier steamer; else he
would have started earlier. In all probability he would be able to
secure a passage on the Mombassa. The Mombassa will reach London about
the 15th of September. As you already know, Miss Müller changed the
date of my visiting Deussen<!--'Volume 5 Page 113'--> to
the 19th September. I shall not be in London to receive Abhedananda. He

Today I received a letter from India written by Abhedânanda that in all probability he had started on the 11th August by the B.I.S.N., ""S.S.Mombassa"". He could not get an earlier steamer; else he would have started earlier. In all probability he would be able to secure a passage on the Mombassa. The Mombassa will reach London about the 15th of September. As you already know, Miss Müller changed the date of my visiting Deussento the 19th September. I shall not be in London to receive Abhedananda. He is also coming without any warm clothing; but I am afraid by that time it will begin to cool in England, and he will require at least some underwear and an overcoat. You know all about these things much better than I. So kindly keep a look out for this Mombassa. I expect also another letter from him.

<p>DEAR NANJUNDA RAO, </p>
<p>I have just now got your letter. I am on the move. I have been
doing a great deal of mountain-climbing<!--'Volume 5 Page 114'-->
and glacier-crossing in the Alps. Now I am going to Germany. I have an
invitation from Prof. Deussen to visit him at Kiel. From thence I go
back to England. Possibly I will return to India this winter. </p>
<p>What I objected to in the design for the <i>Prabuddha
Bhârata</i> was not only its tawdriness, but the crowding in of a
number of figures without any purpose. A design should be simple,
symbolical, and condensed. I will try to make a design for <i>Prabuddha</i>
<i>Bharata</i> in London and send it over to you. . . . </p>
<p>The work is going on beautifully, I am very glad to say. . . .
I will give you one advice however. All combined efforts in India sink
under the weight of one iniquity &#8212; we have not yet developed strict
business principles. Business is business, in the highest sense, and no
friendship &#8212; or as the Hindu proverb says ""eye-shame"" &#8212; should be
there. One should keep the clearest account of everything in one's
charge &#8212; and never, never apply the funds intended for one thing to any
other use whatsoever &#8212; even if one starves the next moment. This is
business integrity. Next, energy unfailing. Whatever you do let that be
your worship for the time. Let this paper be your God for the time, and
you will succeed. </p>
<p>When you have succeeded in this paper, start vernacular ones

<p>I am sure you have got the article on Ramakrishna, I sent you,
by Max Müller. Do not be sorry, he does not mention me there at all, as
it was written six months before he knew me. And then who cares whom he
mentions, if he is right in the main point. I had a beautiful time with
Prof. Deussen in Germany. Later, he and I came together to London, and
we have already become great friends. </p>
<p>I am soon sending you an article on him. Only pray do not put
that old-fashioned ""Dear Sir"" before my articles. Have you seen the
Râja-Yoga book yet? I will try to send you a design for the coming
year. I send you a <i>Daily News</i> article on a book of
travel written by the Czar of Russia. The paragraph in which he speaks
of India as the land of spirituality and wisdom, you ought to quote in
your paper and send the article to the <i>Indian Mirror</i>.
</p>
<p>You are very welcome to publish the Jnâna-Yoga lectures, as
well as Dr. (Nanjunda Rao) in his <i>Awakened India</i> &#8212;
only the simpler ones. They have to be very care<!--'Volume 5 Page 116'-->

is useless for a paper. </p>
<p>I do not think it would be good just now to make the paper a
monthly one yet, unless you are sure of giving a good bulk. As it is
now, the bulk and the matter are all very poor. There is yet a vast
untrodden field, namely &#8212; the writing of the lives and works of
Tulasidâsa, Kabir, Nânak, and of the saints of Southern India. They
should be written in a thorough-going, scholarly style, and not in a
slipshod, slovenly way. In fact, the ideal of the paper, apart from the
preaching of Vedanta, should be to make it a magazine of Indian
research and scholarship, of course, bearing on religion. You must
approach the best writers and get carefully-written articles from their
pen. Work on with all energy. </p>

WESTMINSTER, LONDON. <br>
<i>1896</i></p>
<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>I have returned about three weeks from Switzerland but could
not write you further before. I have sent you by last mail a paper on
Paul Deussen of Kiel. Sturdy's plan about the magazine is still hanging
fire. As you see,<!--'Volume 5 Page 117'--> I have left
the St. George's Road place. We have a lecture hall at 39 Victoria
Street. C/o E. T. Sturdy will always reach me for a year to come. The
rooms at Grey Coat Gardens are only lodgings for self and the other
Swami taken for three mouths only. The work in London is growing apace,
the classes are becoming bigger as they go on. I have no doubt this
will go on increasing at this rate and the English people are steady
and loyal. Of course, as soon as I leave, most of this fabric will
tumble down. Something will happen. Some strong man will arise to take
it up. The Lord knows what is good. In America there is room for twenty
preachers on the Vedanta and Yoga. Where to get these preachers and
where also the money to bring them? Half the United States can be
conquered in ten years, given a number of strong and genuine men. Where
are they? We are all boobies over there! Selfish cowards, with our
nonsense of lip-patriotism, orthodoxy, and boasted religious feeling!
The Madrasis have more of go and steadiness, but every fool is married.
Marriage! Marriage! Marriage! . . . Then the way our boys are married
nowadays! . . . It is very good to aspire to be a nonattached
householder; but what we want in Madras is not that just now &#8212; but
non-marriage. . . . </p>
<p>My child, what I want is muscles of iron and nerves of steel,
inside which dwells a mind of the same material as that of which the
thunderbolt is made. Strength, manhood, Kshatra-Virya + Brahma-Teja.
Our beautiful hopeful boys &#8212; they have everything, only if they are not
slaughtered by the millions at the altar of this brutality they call
marriage. O Lord, hear my wails! Madras will then awake when at least
one hundred of its very heart's blood, in the form of its educated
young men, will stand aside from the world, gird their loins, and be
ready to fight the battle of truth, marching on from country to
country. <a name=""from_east_west""></a>One blow struck outside of India is<!--'Volume 5 Page 118'-->
equal to a hundred thousand struck within. Well, all will come if the
Lord wills it. </p>
<p>Miss Müller was the person who offered that money I promised.
I have told her about your new proposal. She is thinking about it. In
the meanwhile I think it is better to give her some work. She has
consented to be the agent for the <i>Brahmavadin</i> and <i>Awakened
India</i>. Will you write to her about it? Her address is Airlie
Lodge, Ridgeway Gardens, Wimbledon, England. I was living with her over
there for the last few weeks. But the London work cannot go on without
my living in London. As such I have changed quarters. I am sorry it has
chagrined Miss Müller a bit. Cannot help. Her full name is Miss
Henrietta Müller. Max Müller is getting very friendly. I am soon going
to deliver two lectures at Oxford. </p>
<p>I <a name=""from_east_west_1""></a>am busy writing something big on the Vedanta philosophy. I
am busy collecting passages from the various Vedas bearing on the
Vedanta in its threefold aspect. You can help me by getting someone to
collect passages bearing on, first the Advaitic idea, then the
Vishishtâdvaitic, and the Dvaitic from the Samhitâs, the Brâhmanas, the
Upanishads, and the Purânas. They should be classified and very legibly
written with the name and chapter of the book, in each case. It would
be a pity to leave the West without leaving something of the philosophy
in book form. </p>
<p>There was a book published in Mysore in Tamil characters,
comprising all the one hundred and eight Upanishads; I saw it in
Professor Deussen's library. Is there a reprint of the same in
Devanâgari? If so, send me a copy. If not, send me the Tamil edition,
and also write on a sheet the Tamil letters and compounds, and all
juxtaposed with its Nagari equivalents, so that I may learn the Tamil
letters. </p>
<p>Mr. Satyanathan, whom I met in London the other day, said that
there has been a friendly review of my<!--'Volume 5 Page 119'-->
Râja-Yoga book in the <i>Madras Mail</i>, the chief
Anglo-Indian paper in Madras. The leading physiologist in America, I
hear, has been charmed with my speculations. At the same time, there
have been some in England, who ridiculed my ideas. Good! My
speculations of course are awfully bold; a good deal of them will ever
remain meaningless; but there are hints in it which the physiologists
had better taken up earlier. Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied with
the result. ""Let them talk badly of me if they please, but let them
talk"", is my motto. </p>
<p>In England, of course, they are gentlemen and never talk the
rot I had in America. Then again the English missionaries you see over
there are nearly all of them from the dissenters. They are not from the
gentleman class in England. The gentlemen here, who are religious; all
belong to the English Church. The dissenters have very little voice in
England and no education. I never hear of those people here against
whom you time to time warn me. They are unknown here and dare not talk
nonsense. I hope Ram K. Naidu is already in Madras, and you are
enjoying good health. </p>
<p>Persevere on, my brave lads. We have only just begun. Never
despond! Never say enough! . . . As soon as a man comes over to the
West and sees different nations, his eyes open. This way I get strong
workers &#8212; not by talking, but by practically showing what we have in
India and what we have not. I wish at least that a million Hindus had
travelled all over the world! </p>

Miss Müller, and Mr. Goodwin. Mr. and Mrs. Sevier are probably going to
settle in Almora at least for some time, and Goodwin is going to become
a Sannyâsin. He of course will travel with me. It is he to whom we owe
all our books. He took shorthand notes of my lectures, which enabled

<p>(On the eve of the lecture-tour of Dr. Barrows in India at the

among other things as follows:) </p>
<p>Dr. Barrows was the ablest lieutenant Mr. C. Boney could have
selected to carry out successfully his great plan of the Congresses at

that meeting. </p>
<p>Moreover, he comes to us in the sacred name of religion, in
the name of one of the great teachers of mankind, and I am sure, his
exposition of the system of the Prophet of Nazareth would be extremely
liberal and elevating. The Christ-power this man intends to bring to
India is not that of the intolerant, dominant superior, with heart full
of contempt for everything else but its own self, but that of a brother
who craves for a brother's place as a co-worker of the various powers
already working in India. Above all, we must remember that gratitude
and hospitality are the peculiar characteristics of Indian humanity;
and as such, I would beg my countrymen to behave in such a manner that
this stranger from the other side of the globe may find that in the
midst of all our misery, our poverty, and degradation, the heart beats
as warm as of yore, when the ""wealth of Ind"" was the proverb of nations
and India was the land of the ""Aryas"". </p>

<p>I intend to see a little of Ceylon, and shall then go to

a place near Almora in the Himalayas which I intend to make my
Himalayan Centre, as well as a place for Western disciples to live as
Brahmachârins and Sannyâsins. Goodwin is an unmarried young man who is
going to travel and live with me, he is like a Sannyasin. </p>
<p>I am very desirous to reach Calcutta before the birth<!--'Volume 5 Page 124'-->
day festival of Shri Ramakrishna. . . . My present plan of work is to
start two centres, one in Calcutta and the other in Madras, in which to
train up young preachers. I have funds enough to start the one in
Calcutta, which being the scene of Shri Ramakrishna's life-work,
demands my first attention. As for the Madras one, I expect to get
funds in India. </p>
<p>We will begin work with these three centres; and later on, we
will get to Bombay and Allahabad. And from these points, if the Lord is
pleased, we will invade not only India, but send over bands of
preachers to every country in the world. That should be our first duty.
Work on with a heart. 39 Victoria will be the London headquarters for

now canvassing subscribers for it. </p>
<p>Now we have got one Indian magazine in English fixed. We can
start some in the vernaculars also. Miss M. Noble of Wimbledon is a
great worker. She will also canvass for both the Madras papers. She
will write you. These things will grow slowly but surely. Papers of
this kind are supported by a small circle of followers. Now they cannot
be expected to do too many things at a time &#8212; they have to buy the
books, find the money for the work in England, subscribers for the
paper here, and then subscribe to Indian papers. It is too much. It is
more like trading than teaching. Therefore you must wait, and yet I am
sure there will be a few subscribers here. Again, there must be work
for the people here to do when I am gone, else the whole thing will go
to pieces. Therefore there must be a paper here, so also in America by
and by. The Indian papers are to be supported by the Indians. To make a
paper equally acceptable to all nationalities means a staff of writers
from all nations; and that means at least a hundred thousand rupees a
year. </p>

THE MAHARAJA OF BURDWAN'S HOUSE, <br>
DARJEELING, <br>
<i>6th April, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>HONOURED MADAM, (Shrimati Sarala Ghoshal &#8212; Editor, <i>Bharati</i>)
</p>
<p>I feel much obliged for the <i>Bhârati</i> sent
by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause, to which my
humble life has been dedicated, has been able to win the approbation
off highly talented ladies like you. </p>
<p>In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the
initiator off new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him
encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land. It is therefore
that the approbation of an educated Bengali lady is more valuable than
the loud applause of all the men of India. </p>
<p>May the Lord grant that many women like you be born in this
country, and devote their lives to the betterment of their motherland! </p>
<p>I have something to say in regard to the article you have
written about me in the <i>Bharati</i>. It is this. It has
been for the good of India that religious preaching in the West has
been and will be done. It has ever been my conviction that we shall not
be able to rise unless the Western people come to our help. In this
country no appreciation of merit can yet be found, no financial
strength, and what is most lamentable of all, there is not a bit of
practicality. </p>
<p>There are many things to be done, but means are wanting in
this country. We have brains, but no hands.<!--'Volume 5 Page 127'-->
We have the doctrine of Vedanta, but we have not the power to reduce it
into practice. In our books there is the doctrine of universal
equality, but in work we make great distinctions. It was in India that
unselfish and disinterested work of the most exalted type was preached
but in practice <i>we</i> are awfully cruel, awfully
heartless &#8212; unable to think of anything besides our own mass-of-flesh
bodies. </p>
<p>Yet it is only through the present state of things that it is
possible to proceed to work. There is no other way. Every one has the
power to judge of good end evil, but he is the hero who undaunted by
the waves of Samsâra &#8212; which is full of errors, delusions, and miseries
&#8212; with one hand wipes the tears, and with the other, unshaken, shows
the path of deliverance. On the one hand there is the conservative
society, like a mass of inert matter; on the other the restless,
impatient, fire-darting reformer; the way to good lies between the two.
I heard in Japan that it was the belief of the girls of that country
that their dolls would be animated if they were loved with all their
heart. The Japanese girl never breaks her doll. O you of great fortune!
I too believe that India will awake again if anyone could love with all
his heart the people of the country &#8212; bereft of the grace of affluence,
of blasted fortune, their discretion totally lost, downtrodden,
ever-starved, quarrelsome, and envious. Then only will India awake,
when hundreds of large-hearted men and women, giving up all desires of
enjoying the luxuries of life, will long and exert themselves to their
utmost for the well-being of the millions of their countrymen who are
gradually sinking lower and lower in the vortex of destitution and
ignorance. I have experienced even in my insignificant life that good
motives, sincerity, and infinite love can conquer the world. One single
soul possessed of these virtues can destroy the dark designs of
millions of hypocrites and brutes. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 128'-->
<p>My going to the West again is yet uncertain; if I go, know
that too will be for India. Where is the strength of men in this
country? Where is the strength of money? Many men and women of the West
are ready to do good to India by serving even the lowest Chandâlas, in
the Indian way, and through the Indian religion. How many such are
there in this country? And financial strength! To meet the expenses or
my reception, the people of Calcutta made me deliver a lecture and sold
tickets! . . . I do not blame nor censure anybody for this, I only want
to show that our well-being is impossible without men and money coming
from the West. </p>

HONOURED MADAM, (Shrimati Sarala Ghoshal — Editor,Bharati)

I feel much obliged for theBhâratisent by you, and consider myself fortunate that the cause, to which my humble life has been dedicated, has been able to win the approbation off highly talented ladies like you.

In this battle of life, men are rare who encourage the initiator off new thought, not to speak of women who would offer him encouragement, particularly in our unfortunate land. It is therefore that the approbation of an educated Bengali lady is more valuable than the loud applause of all the men of India.

May the Lord grant that many women like you be born in this country, and devote their lives to the betterment of their motherland!

I have something to say in regard to the article you have written about me in theBharati. It is this. It has been for the good of India that religious preaching in the West has been and will be done. It has ever been my conviction that we shall not be able to rise unless the Western people come to our help. In this country no appreciation of merit can yet be found, no financial strength, and what is most lamentable of all, there is not a bit of practicality.

There are many things to be done, but means are wanting in this country. We have brains, but no hands.We have the doctrine of Vedanta, but we have not the power to reduce it into practice. In our books there is the doctrine of universal equality, but in work we make great distinctions. It was in India that unselfish and disinterested work of the most exalted type was preached but in practiceweare awfully cruel, awfully heartless — unable to think of anything besides our own mass-of-flesh bodies.

Yet it is only through the present state of things that it is possible to proceed to work. There is no other way. Every one has the power to judge of good end evil, but he is the hero who undaunted by the waves of Samsâra — which is full of errors, delusions, and miseries — with one hand wipes the tears, and with the other, unshaken, shows the path of deliverance. On the one hand there is the conservative society, like a mass of inert matter; on the other the restless, impatient, fire-darting reformer; the way to good lies between the two. I heard in Japan that it was the belief of the girls of that country that their dolls would be animated if they were loved with all their heart. The Japanese girl never breaks her doll.

<p class=""right"">ALMORA, <br>
<i>29th May, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR DOCTOR SHASHI (BHUSHAN GHOSH), </p>
<p>Your letter and the two bottles containing the medicines were
duly received. I have begun from last evening a trial of your
medicines. Hope the combination will have a better effect than the one
alone. </p>
<p>I began to take a lot of exercise on horseback, both morning
and evening. Since that I am very much better indeed. I was so much
better the first week of my gymnastics that I have scarcely felt so
well since I was a boy and used to have <i>kusti</i>
(wrestling) exercises. I really began to feel that it was a pleasure to
have a body. Every movement made me conscious of strength &#8212; every
movement of the muscles was pleasurable. That exhilarating feeling has
subsided somewhat, yet I feel very strong. In a trial of strength I
could make both G. G. and Niranjan go down before me in a minute. In
Darjeeling I always felt that I was not the same man. Here I feel that
I have<!--'Volume 5 Page 129'--> no disease whatsoever,
but there is one marked change. I never in my life could sleep as soon
as I got into bed. I must toss for at least two hours. Only from Madras
to Darjeeling (during the first month) I would sleep as soon as my head
touched the pillow. That ready disposition to sleep is gone now
entirely, and my old tossing habit and feeling hot after the evening
meal have come back. I do not feel any heat after the day meal. There
being an orchard here, I began to take more fruit than usual as soon as
I came. But the only fruit to be got here now is the apricot. I am
trying to get more varieties from Naini Tâl. There has not been any
thirst even though the days are fearfully hot. . . . On the whole my
own feeling is one of revival of great strength and cheerfulness, and a
feeling of exuberant health, only I am afraid I am getting fat on a too
much milk diet. Don't you listen to what Yogen writes. He is a
hypochondriac himself and wants to make everybody so. I ate
one-sixteenth of a <i>barphi</i> (sweetmeat) in Lucknow,
and that according to Yogen was what put me out of sorts in Almora!
Yogen is expected here in a few days. I am going to take him in hand.
By the by, I am very susceptible to malarious influences. The first
week's indisposition at Almora might have been caused to a certain
extent by my passage through the <i>Terai</i>. Anyhow I
feel very, very strong now. You ought to see me, Doctor, when I sit
meditating in front of the beautiful snow-peaks and repeat from the
Upanishads: ""<span lang=""sa"">&#2344; &#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2352;&#2379;&#2327;&#2379; &#2344; &#2332;&#2352;&#2366; &#2344; &#2350;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2369;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2346;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2351;&#2379;&#2327;&#2366;&#2327;&#2381;&#2344;&#2367;&#2350;&#2351;&#2306; &#2358;&#2352;&#2368;&#2352;&#2350;&#2381;
&#8212;</span> He has neither disease, nor decay, nor death; for, verily,
he has obtained a body full of the fire of Yoga."" </p>

in the great work. . . . </p>

<i>1st June, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MR.&#8212;, </p>
<p>The objections you show about the Vedas would be valid if the
word Vedas meant Samhitâs. The word Vedas includes the three parts, the
Samhitas, the Brâhmanas, and the Upanishads, according to the
universally received opinion in India. Of these, the first two
portions, as being the ceremonial parts, have been nearly put out of
sight; the Upanishads have alone been taken up by all our philosophers
and founders of sects. </p>
<p>The idea that the Samhitas are the only Vedas is very recent
and has been started by the late Swâmi Dayânanda. This opinion has not
got any hold on the orthodox population. </p>
<p>The reason of this opinion was that Swami Dayananda thought he
could find a consistent theory of the whole, based on a new
interpretation of the Samhitas, but the difficulties remained the same,
only they fell back on the Brahmanas. And in spite of the theories of
interpretation and interpolation a good deal still remains. </p>
<p>Now if it is possible to build a consistent religion on the
Samhitas, it is a thousand times more sure that a very consistent and
harmonious faith can be based upon the Upanishads, and moreover, here
one has not to go against the already received national opinion. Here
all the Âchâryas (Teachers) of the past would side with you, and you
have a vast scope for new progress. </p>
<p>The Gita no doubt has already become the Bible of Hinduism,
and it fully deserves to be so; but the personality of Krishna has
become so covered with haze that it is impossible today to draw any
life-giving inspiration from that <i>life</i>. Moreover,
the present age requires new modes of thought and new life. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 131'-->

of two kinds, with or without purpose. If the latter, none but
worm-eaten brains will try for it. But if the other is referred to,
then renunciation would mean the withdrawal of the mind from other
things and concentrating it on God or Atman. The Lord of all cannot be
any particular individual. He must be the sum total. One possessing
Vairagya does not understand by Atman the individual ego but the
All-pervading Lord, residing as the Self and Internal Ruler in all. He
is perceivable by all as the sum total. This being so, as Jiva and
Ishvara are in essence the same, serving the Jivas and loving God must
mean one and the same thing. Here is a peculiarity: when you serve a
Jiva with the idea that he is a Jiva, it is Dayâ (compassion) and not
Prema (love); but when you serve him with the idea that he is the Self,
that is Prema. That the Atman is the one objective of love is known
from Shruti, Smriti, and direct perception. Bhagavân Chaitanya was
right, therefore, when he said, ""Love to God and compassion to the
Jivas"". This conclusion of the Bhagavan, intimating differentiation
between Jiva and Ishvara, was right, as He was a dualist. But for us,
Advaitists, this notion of Jiva as distinct from God is the cause of
bondage. Our principle, therefore, should be love, and not compassion.
The application of the word compassion even to Jiva seems to me to be
rash and vain. For us, it is not to pity but to serve. Ours is not the
feeling of compassion but of love, and the feeling of Self in all. </p>

<h2>LXXVIII</h2>
<p class=""right"">ALMORA, <br>
<i>9th July, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTER, (Miss Mary Hale.) </p>
<p>I am very sorry to read between the lines the desponding tone
of your letter, and I understand the cause; thank you for your warning,
I understand your motive perfectly. I had arranged to go with Ajit
Singh to England; but the doctors not allowing, it fell through. I
shall be so happy to learn that Harriet has met him. He will be only
too glad to meet any of you. </p>
<p>I had also a lot of cuttings from different American papers
fearfully criticising my utterances about American women and furnishing
me with the strange news that I had been outcasted! As if I had any
caste to lose, being a Sannyâsin! </p>
<p>Not only no caste has been lost, but it has considerably
shattered the opposition to sea-voyage &#8212; my going to the West. If I
should have to be outcasted, it would be with half the ruling princes
of India and almost all of educated India. On the other hand, a leading
Raja of the caste to which I belonged before my entering the order got
up a banquet in my honour, at which were most of the <i>big bugs</i>
of that caste. The Sannyasins, on the other hand, may not dine with any
one in India, as it<!--'Volume 5 Page 135'--> would be
beneath the dignity of gods to dine with mere mortals. They are
regarded as Nârâyanas, while the others are mere men. And dear Mary,
these feet have been washed and wiped and worshipped by the descendants
of kings, and there has been a progress through the country which none
ever commanded in India. </p>
<p>It will suffice to say that the police were necessary to keep
order if I ventured out into the street! That is outcasting indeed! Of
course, that took the starch out of the missionaries, and who are they
here? &#8212; Nobodies. We are in blissful ignorance of their existence all
the time. I had in a lecture said something about the missionaries and
the origin of that species except the English Church gentlemen, and in
that connection had to refer to the very churchy women of America and
their power of inventing scandals. This the missionaries are parading
as an attack on American women <i>en masse</i> to undo my
work there, as they well know that anything said against themselves
will rather please the U.S. people. My dear Mary, supposing I had said
all sorts of fearful things against the ""Yanks"" &#8212; would that be paying
off a millionth part of what they say of our <i>mothers</i>
and <i>sisters</i>? ""Neptune's waters"" would be perfectly
useless to wash off the hatred the Christian ""Yanks"" of both sexes bear
to us ""heathens of India"" &#8212; and what harm have we done them? Let the
""Yanks"" learn to be patient under criticism and then criticise others.
It is a well-known psychological fact that those who are ever ready to
abuse others cannot bear the slightest touch of criticism from others.
Then again, what do I owe them? Except your family, Mrs. Bull, the
Leggetts, and a few other kind persons, who else has been kind to me?
Who came forward to help me work out my ideas? I had to work till I am
at death's door and had to spend nearly the whole of that energy in
America, so that the Americans may learn to be broader and more
spiritual. In England I worked only<!--'Volume 5 Page 136'-->
six months. There was not a breath of scandal save one, and that was
the working of an American woman, which greatly relieved my English
friends &#8212; not only no attacks but many of the best English Church
clergymen became my firm friends, and without asking I got much help
for my work, and I am sure to get much more. There is a society
watching my work and getting help for it, and four respectable persons
followed me to India to help my work, and dozens were ready, and the
next time I go, hundreds will be. </p>
<p>Dear, dear Mary, do not be afraid for me. . . The world is
big, very big, and there must be some place for me even if the
""Yankees"" rage. Anyhow, I am quite satisfied with my work. I never
planned anything. I have taken things as they came. Only one idea was
burning in my brain &#8212; to start the machine for elevating the Indian
masses &#8212; and that I have succeeded in doing to a certain extent. It
would have made your heart glad to see how my boys are working in the
midst of famine and disease and misery &#8212; nursing by the mat-bed of the
cholera-stricken Pariah and feeding the starving Chandâla &#8212; and the
Lord sends help to me and to them all. ""What are men?"" He is with me,
the Beloved, He was when I was in America, in England, when I was
roaming about unknown from place to place in India. What do I care
about what they talk &#8212; the babies, they do not know any better. What!
I, who have realised the Spirit and the vanity of all earthly nonsense,
to be swerved from my path by babies' prattle! Do I look like that? </p>
<p>I had to talk a lot about myself because I owned that to you.
I feel my task is done &#8212; at most three or four years more of life are
left. I have lost all wish for my salvation. I never wanted earthly
enjoyments. I must see my machine in strong working order, and then
knowing sure that I have put in a lever for the good of humanity, in
India at least, which no power can drive<!--'Volume 5 Page 137'-->
back, I will sleep, without caring what will be next; <a name=""from_remi_098_ksrs""></a>and may I be born again
and again, and suffer thousands of miseries so that I may worship the
only God that exists, the only God I believe in, the sum total of all
souls &#8212; and above all, my God the wicked, my God the miserable, my God
the poor of all races, of all species, is the special object of my
worship. </p>
<p>""He who is in you and is outside of you, who works through
every hand, who walks through every foot, whose body you are, Him
worship, and break all other idols. </p>
<p>""He who is the high and the low, the saint and the sinner, the
god and the worm, Him worship, the visible, the knowable, the real, the
omnipresent, break all other idols. </p>
<p>""In whom there is neither past life nor future birth, nor
death nor going or coming, in whom we always have been and always will
be one, Him worship, break all other idols. </p>
<p>""Ay, fools, neglecting the living Gods and His infinite
reflection with which the world is full, and running after imaginary
shadows! Him worship, the only visible, and break all other idols."" </p>
<p>My time is short. I have got to unbreast whatever I have to
say, without caring if it smarts some or irritates others. Therefore,
my dear Mary, do not be frightened at whatever drops from my lips, for
the power behind me is not Vivekananda but He the Lord, and He knows
best. If I have to please the world, that will be injuring the world;
the voice of the majority is wrong, seeing that they govern and make
the sad state of the world. Every new thought must create opposition &#8212;
in the civilised a polite sneer, in the vulgar savage howls and filthy
scandals. </p>
<p>Even these earthworms must stand erect, even children must see
light. The Americans are drunk with new wine. A hundred waves of
prosperity have come and gone over my country. We have learned the
lesson<!--'Volume 5 Page 138'--> which no child can yet
understand. It is vanity. This hideous world is Maya. Renounce and be
happy. Give up the idea of sex and possessions. There is no other bond.
Marriage and sex and money are the only living devils. All earthly love
proceeds from the body. No sex, no possessions; as these fall off, the
eyes open to spiritual vision. The soul regains its own infinite power.
How I wish I were in England to see Harriet. I have one wish left &#8212; to
see you four sisters before I die, and that must happen. </p>

<p>MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Leggett.) </p>
<p>Many many thanks for your beautiful and kind letter. I wish I
were in London to be able to accept the invitation with the Raja of
Khetri. I had a great many dinners to attend in London last season. But
it was fated not to be, and my health did not permit my going over with
the Raja. </p>
<p>So Alberta is once more at home in America. I owe her a debt
of gratitude for all she did for me in Rome. How is Holli? To both of
them my love, and kiss the new baby for me, my youngest sister. </p>
<p>I have been taking some rest in the Himalayas for nine months.
Now I am going down to the plains to be harnessed once more for work. </p>
<p>To Frankincense and Joe Joe and Mabel my love, and so to you
eternally. </p>

<p>Many many thanks for your second leaflet (leaves from the <i>Gospel</i>).
It is indeed wonderful. The move is quite original, and never was the

beyond all praise, so fresh, so pointed, and withal so plain and easy. </p>
<p>I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the
leaflets. I am really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't
it? Our Teacher and Lord was so original, and each one of us will have
to be original or nothing. I now understand why none of us attempted
his life before. It has been reserved for you, this great work. He is

<i>3rd January, 1899</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Mrinalini Bose) </p>
<p>Some very important questions have been raised in your letter.
It is not possible to answer them fully in a short note, still I reply
to them as briefly as possible. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 145'-->
<p>(1) Rishi, Muni, or God &#8212; none has power to force an
institution on society. When the needs of the times press hard on it,
society adopts certain customs for self-preservation. Rishis have only
recorded those customs As a man often resorts even to such means as are
good for immediate self-protection but which are very injurious in the
future, similarly society also not unfrequently saves itself for the
time being, but these immediate means which contributed to its
preservation turn out to be terrible in the long run. </p>
<p>For example, take the prohibition of widow-marriage in our
country. Don't think that Rishis or wicked men introduced the law
pertaining to it. Notwithstanding the desire of men to keep women
completely under their control, they never could succeed in introducing
those laws without betaking themselves to the aid of a social necessity
of the time. Of this custom two points should be specially observed: </p>
<p class=""poem"">(a) Widow-marriage takes place among the
lower classes. </p>
<p class=""poem"">(b) Among the higher classes the number of
women is greater than that of men.</p>
<p>Now, if it be the rule to marry every girl, it is difficult
enough to get one husband apiece; then how to get, in succession, two
or three for each? Therefore has society put one party under
disadvantage, i.e. it does not let her have a second husband, who has
had one; if it did, one maid would have to go without a husband. On the
other hand, widow-marriage obtains in communities having a greater
number of men than women, as in their case the objection stated above
does not exist. It is becoming more and more difficult in the West,
too, for unmarried girls to get husbands. </p>
<p>Similar is the case with the caste system and other social
customs. </p>
<p>So, if it be necessary to change any social custom<!--'Volume 5 Page 146'-->
the<i> necessity</i> underlying it should be found out
first of all, and by altering it, the custom will die of itself.
Otherwise no good will be done by condemnation or praise. </p>
<p>(2) Now the question is: Is it for the good of the public at
large that social rules are framed or society is formed? Many reply to
this in the affirmative; some, again, may hold that it is not so. Some
men, being comparatively powerful, slowly bring all others under their
control and by stratagem, force, or adroitness gain their own objects.
If this be true, what can be the meaning of the statement that there is
danger in giving liberty to the ignorant? What, again, is the meaning
of liberty? </p>
<p>Liberty does not certainly mean the absence of obstacles in
the path of misappropriation of wealth etc. by you and me, but it is
our natural right to be allowed to use our own body, intelligence, or
wealth according to our will, without doing any harm to others; and all
the members of a society ought to have the same opportunity for
obtaining wealth, education, or knowledge. The second question is:
Those who say that if the ignorant and the poor be given liberty, i.e.
full right to their body, wealth, etc., and if their children have the
same opportunity to better their condition and acquire knowledge as
those of the rich and the highly situated, they would become perverse &#8212;
do they say this for the good of society or blinded by their
selfishness? In England too I have heard, ""Who will serve us if the
lower classes get education?"" </p>
<p>For the luxury of a handful of the rich, let millions of men
and women remain submerged in the hell of want and abysmal depth of
ignorance, for if they get wealth and education, society will be upset!
</p>
<p>Who constitute society? The millions &#8212; or you, I, and a few
others of the upper classes? </p>
<p>Again, even if the latter be true, what ground is there for
our vanity that we lead others? Are we omniscient? &#2313;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2375;&#2342;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2344;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2306;
&#8212; One should raise the self by the self."" Let
each one work out one's own salvation. Freedom in all matters, i.e.
advance towards Mukti is the worthiest gain of man. To advance oneself
towards freedom &#8212; physical, mental, and spiritual &#8212; and help others to
do so, is the supreme prize of man. Those social rules which stand in
the way of the unfoldment of this freedom are injurious, and steps
should be taken to destroy them speedily. Those institutions should be
encouraged by which men advance in the path of freedom. </p>
<p>That in this life we feel a deep love at first sight towards a
particular person who may not be endowed with extraordinary qualities,
is explained by the thinkers of our country as due to the associations
of a past incarnation. </p>
<p>Your question regarding the will is very interesting: it is
the subject to know. The essence of all religions is the annihilation
of desire, along with which comes, of a certainty, the annihilation of
the will as well, for desire is only the name of a particular mode of
the will. Why, again, is this world? Or why are these manifestations of
the will? Some religions hold that the evil will should be destroyed
and not the good. The denial of desire here would be compensated by
enjoyments hereafter. This reply does not of course satisfy the wise.
The Buddhists, on the other hand, say that desire is the cause of
misery, its annihilation is quite desirable. But like killing a man in
the effort to kill the mosquito on his cheek, they have gone to the
length of annihilating their own selves in their efforts to destroy
misery according to the Buddhistic doctrine. </p>
<p>The fact is, what we call will is an inferior modification of
something higher. Desirelessness means the disappearance of the
inferior modification in the form of will and the appearance of that
superior state. That state is beyond the range of mind and intellect.
But<!--'Volume 5 Page 148'--> though the look of the gold
mohur is quite different from that of the rupee and the pice, yet as we
know for certain that the gold mohur is greater than either, so, that
highest state &#8212; Mukti, or Nirvâna, call it what you like &#8212; though out
of the reach of the mind and intellect, is greater than the will and
all other powers. It is no power, but power is its modification,
therefore it is higher. Now you will see that the result of the proper
exercise of the will, first with motive for an object and then without
motive, is that the will-power will attain a much higher state. </p>
<p>In the preliminary state, the form of the Guru is to be
meditated upon by the disciple. Gradually it is to be merged in the
Ishta. By Ishta is meant the object of love and devotion. . . . It is
very difficult to superimpose divinity on man, but one is sure to
succeed by repeated efforts. God is in every man, whether man knows it
or not; your loving devotion is bound to call up the divinity in him. </p>

<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, (Swami Ramakrishnananda) </p>
<p>I am going with my mother to Rameswaram, that is all. I don't
know whether I shall go to Madras at all. If I go, it will be strictly
private. My body and mind are completely worked out; I cannot stand a
single person. I do not want anybody. I have neither the strength nor
the money, nor the will to take up anybody with me. Bhaktas (devotees)
of Guru Maharaj or not, it does not matter. It was very foolish of you
even to ask such a question. Let me tell you again, I am more dead than
alive, and strictly refuse to see anybody. If you cannot manage this, I
don't go to Madras. I have to become a bit selfish to save my body. </p>
<p>Let Yogin-Ma and others go their own way. I shall not take up
any company in my present state of health. </p>

<p>Sometimes it is hard work to be tied to the shoestrings of a

the 22nd January, 1901. You tied me to the latchet of a great name,

down the world. Now it reached me yesterday from Japan, where Miss
MacLeod is at present. Well, this, therefore, is the solution of the
sphinx's riddle. ""Thou shalt not join a great name with a small one."" </p>

fall, suffered all through winter, and went this summer touring through
Eastern Bengal and Assam &#8212; through a land of giant rivers and hills and
malaria &#8212; and after hard work of two months had a collapse, and am now
back to Calcutta slowly recovering from the effects of it. </p>
<p>The Raja of Khetri died from a fall a few months ago. So you
see things are all gloomy with me just now, and my own health is
wretched. Yet I am sure to bob up soon and am waiting for the next
turn. </p>
<p>I wish I were in Europe, just to have a long chat with you,
and then return as quick to India; for, after all, I feel a sort of
quiet nowadays, and have done with three-fourths of my restlessness. </p>

<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, (Swami Ramakrishnanada) </p>
<p>Reading your letter I felt like laughing, and also rather
sorry. The cause of the laughter is that you had a<!--'Volume 5 Page 161'-->
dream through indigestion and made yourself miserable, taking it to be
real. The cause of my sorrow is that it is clear from this that your
health is not good, and that your nerves require rest very badly. </p>
<p>Never have I laid a curse on you, and why should I do so now?
All your life you have known my love for you, and today are you
doubting it? True, my temper was ever bad, and nowadays owing to
illness it occasionally becomes terrible &#8212; but know this for certain
that my love can never cease. </p>
<p>My health nowadays is becoming a little better. Have the rains
started in Madras? When the rains begin a little in the South, I may go
to Madras via Bombay and Poona. With the onset of the rains the
terrible heat of the South will perhaps subside. </p>
<p>My great love to you and all others. Yesterday Sharat returned
to the Math from Darjeeling &#8212; his health is much better than it was
before. I have come here after a tour of East Bengal and Assam. All
work has its ups and downs, its periods of intensity and slackness.
Again it will rise up. What fear? . . . . </p>
<p>Whatever that may be, I say that you stop your work for some
time and come straight back to the Math. After you have taken a month's
rest here, you and I together will make a grand tour via Gujarat,
Bombay, Poona, Hyderabad, Mysore to Madras. Would not that be grand? If
you cannot do this, stop your lectures in Madras for a month. Take a
little good food and sleep well. Within two or three months I shall go
there. In any case, reply immediately as to what you decide to do. </p>

HOWRAH DIST., <br>
<i>14th June, 1901</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.) </p>
<p>I am so glad you are enjoying Japan &#8212; especially Japanese art.
You are perfectly correct in saying that we will have to learn many
things from Japan. The help that Japan will give us will be with great
sympathy and respect, whereas that from the West unsympathetic and
destructive. Certainly it is very desirable to establish a connection
between India and Japan. </p>
<p>As for me, I was thrown <i>hors de combat</i> in
Assam. The climate of the Math is just reviving me a bit. At Shillong &#8212;
the hill sanatorium of Assam &#8212; I had fever, asthma, increase of
albumen, and my body swelled to almost twice its normal size. These
symptoms subsided, however, as soon as I reached the Math. It is
dreadfully hot this year; but a bit of rain has commenced, and I hope
we will soon have the monsoon in full force. I have no plans just now,
except that the Bombay Presidency wants me so badly that I think of
going there soon. We are thinking of starting touring through Bombay in
a week or so. </p>
<p>The 300 dollars you speak of sent by Lady Betty have not
reached me yet, nor have I any intimation of its arrival from General
Patterson. </p>
<p>He, poor man, was rather miserable, after his wife and
children sailed for Europe and asked me to come and see him, but
unfortunately I was so ill, and am so afraid of going into the City
that I must wait till the rains have set in. </p>
<p>Now, Joe dear, if I am to go to Japan, this time it is
necessary that I take Saradananda with me to carry on<!--'Volume 5 Page 163'-->
the work. Also I must have the promised letter to Li Huang Chang from
Mr. Maxim; but Mother knows the rest. I am still undecided. </p>
<p>So you went to Alanquinan to see the foreteller? Did he
convince you of his powers? What did he say? Write particular <i>s&#8217;il
vous plait</i>. </p>
<p>Jules Bois went as far as Lahore, being prevented from
entering Nepal. I learn from the papers that he could not bear the heat
and fell ill; then he took ship <i>et bon voyage</i>. He
did not write me a single line since we met in the Math. You also are
determined to drag Mrs. Bull down to Japan from Norway all the way &#8212; <i>bien,
Mademoiselle, vous êtes use puissante magicienne, sans doute</i>.
(Well, Miss, you are undoubtedly a powerful magician.). Well, Joe, keep
health and spirits up; the Alanquinan man's words come out true most of
them; and <i>glorie et honneur</i> await you &#8212; and Mukti.
The natural ambition of woman is through marriage to climb up, leaning
upon a man; but those days are gone. You shall be great without the
help of any man, just as you are, plain, dear Joe &#8212; our Joe,
everlasting Joe. . . .</p>
<p>We have seen enough of this life to care for any of its
bubbles have we not Joe? For months I have been practicing to drive
away all sentiments; therefore I stop here, and good-bye just now. It
is ordained by Mother we work together; it has been already for the
good of many; it shall be for the good of many more; so let it be. It
is useless planning, useless high flights; Mother will find Her own
way; . . . rest assured. </p>

has been and is very bad. I recover for a few days only; then comes the

worth one's while to see. </p>
<p>My country is, as you know, the land of waters. But never did
I realise before what that meant. The rivers of East Bengal are oceans
of rolling fresh water, not rivers, and so long that steamers work on
them for weeks. Miss MacLeod is in Japan. She is of course charmed with
the country and asked me to come over, but my health not permitting
such a long voyage, I desisted. I have seen Japan before. </p>

<p>Sam is with you this year &#8212; I am so glad! He must be enjoying
the good things of Europe after his dreary experience in the North. I
have not made any interesting friends of late, and the old ones that

died of a fall from a high tower at Secundra, the tomb of Emperor
Akbar. He was repairing this old grand piece of architecture at his own

footing, and it was a sheer fall of several hundred feet. Thus we
sometimes come to grief on account of our zeal for antiquity. Take
care, Mary, don't be too zealous for your piece of Indian antiquity. </p>

<h2>CXIV</h2>
<p class=""right"">GOPAL LAL VILLA, <br>
BENARES (VARANASI) CANTONMENT, <br>
<i>9th February, 1902</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SWARUP(ÂNANDA), </p>
<p>. . . In answer to Châru's letter, tell him to study the <i>Brahma-Sutras</i>
himself. What does he mean by the <i>Brahma-Sutras </i>containing
references to Buddhism? He means the Bhâshyas, of course, or rather
ought to mean, and Shankara was only the last Bhâshyakâra
(commentator). There are references, though in Buddhistic literature,
to Vedanta, and the Mahâyâna school of Buddhism is even Advaitistic.
Why does Amara Singha, a Buddhist, give as one of the names of Buddha &#8212;
Advayavâdi ? Charu writes, the word Brahman does not occur in the
Upanishads! <i>Quelle bêtise</i>! </p>
<p>I hold the Mahayana to be the older of the two schools of
Buddhism. </p>
<p>The theory of Mâyâ is as old as the Rik-Samhitâ. The
Shvetâshvatara Upanishad contains the word ""Maya"" which is developed
out of Prakriti. I hold that Upanishad to be at least older than
Buddhism. </p>
<p>I have had much light of late about Buddhism, and I am ready
to prove: </p>
<p>(1) That Shiva-worship, in various forms, antedated the
Buddhists, that the Buddhists tried to get hold of the sacred places of
the Shaivas but, failing in that, made new places in the precincts just
as you find now at Bodh-Gayâ and Sârnâth (Varanasi). </p>
<p>(2) The story in the Agni Purâna about Gayâsura does not refer
to Buddha at all &#8212; as Dr. Rajendralal will have it &#8212; but simply to a
pre-existing story. </p>
<p>(3) That Buddha went to live on Gayâshirsha mountain proves
the pre-existence of the place. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 173'-->
<p>(4) Gaya was a place of ancestor-worship already, and the
footprint-worship the Buddhists copied from the Hindus. </p>
<p>(5) About Varanasi, even the oldest records go to prove it as
the great place of Shiva-worship; etc., etc. </p>
<p>Many are the new facts I have gathered in Bodh-Gaya and from
Buddhist literature. Tell Charu to read for himself, and not be swayed
by foolish opinions. </p>
<p>I am rather well here, in Varanasi, and if I go on improving
in this way, it will be a great gain. </p>
<p>A total revolution has occurred in my mind about the relation
of Buddhism and Neo-Hinduism. I may not live to work out the glimpses,

. . . In answer to Châru's letter, tell him to study theBrahma-Sutrashimself. What does he mean by theBrahma-Sutrascontaining references to Buddhism? He means the Bhâshyas, of course, or rather ought to mean, and Shankara was only the last Bhâshyakâra (commentator). There are references, though in Buddhistic literature, to Vedanta, and the Mahâyâna school of Buddhism is even Advaitistic. Why does Amara Singha, a Buddhist, give as one of the names of Buddha — Advayavâdi ? Charu writes, the word Brahman does not occur in the Upanishads!Quelle bêtise!

I hold the Mahayana to be the older of the two schools of Buddhism.

The theory of Mâyâ is as old as the Rik-Samhitâ. The Shvetâshvatara Upanishad contains the word ""Maya"" which is developed out of Prakriti. I hold that Upanishad to be at least older than Buddhism.

I have had much light of late about Buddhism, and I am ready to prove:

(1) That Shiva-worship, in various forms, antedated the Buddhists, that the Buddhists tried to get hold of the sacred places of the Shaivas but, failing in that, made new places in the precincts just as you find now at Bodh-Gayâ and Sârnâth (Varanasi).

(2) The story in the Agni Purâna about Gayâsura does not refer to Buddha at all — as Dr. Rajendralal will have it — but simply to a pre-existing story.

(3) That Buddha went to live on Gayâshirsha mountain proves the pre-existence of the place.

(4) Gaya was a place of ancestor-worship already, and the footprint-worship the Buddhists copied from the Hindus.

(5) About Varanasi, even the oldest records go to prove it as the great place of Shiva-worship; etc., etc.

Many are the new facts I have gathered in Bodh-Gaya and from Buddhist literature. Tell Charu to read for himself, and not be swayed by foolish opinions.

I am rather well here, in Varanasi, and if I go on improving in this way, it will be a great gain.

A total revolution has occurred in my mind about the relation of Buddhism and Neo-Hinduism. I may not live to work out the glimpses, but I shall leave the lines of work indicated, and you and your brethren will have to work it out.","Yours with all blessings and love,

<p><br>
Welcome to India once more, dear mother (Mrs. Ole Bull) and daughter. A
copy of a Madras journal that I received through the kindness of Joe
delighted me exceedingly, as the reception Niveditâ had in Madras was
for the good of both Nivedita and Madras. Her speech was indeed
beautiful. </p>
<p>I hope you are resting well after your long journey, and so is
Nivedita. I wish it so much that you should go for a few hours to a few
villages west of Calcutta to see the old Bengali structures made of
wood, bamboo, cane, mica, and grass. </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 174'-->
<p>These are the bungalows, most artistic. Alas! the name is
travestied nowadays by every pigsty appropriating the name. </p>
<p>In old days a man who built a palace still built a bungalow
for the reception of guests. The art is dying out. I wish I could build
the whole of Nivedita's School in that style. Yet it is good to see the
few that yet remained, at least one. </p>
<p>Brahmananda will arrange for it, and you have only to take a
journey of a few hours. </p>
<p>Mr. Okakura has started on his short tour. He intends to visit
Agra, Gwalior, Ajanta, Ellora, Chittore, Udaipur, Jaipur, and Delhi. </p>
<p>A very well-educated rich young man of Varanasi, with whose
father we had a long-standing friendship, came back to this city
yesterday. He is especially interested in art, and spending purposely a
lot of money in his attempts to revive dying Indian arts. He came to
see me only a few hours after Mr. Okakura left. He is just the man to
show him artistic India (i.e. what little is left), and I am sure he
will be much benefited by Okakura's suggestions. Okakura just found a
common terracotta water-vessel here used by the servants. The shape and
the embossed work on it simply charmed him, but as it is common
earthenware and would not bear the journey, he left a request with me
to have it reproduced in brass. I was at my wit's end as to what to do.
My young friend comes a few hours after, and not only undertakes to
have it done but offers to show a few hundreds of embossed designs in
terracotta infinitely superior to the one Okakura fancied. </p>
<p>He also offers to show us old paintings in that wonderful old
style. Only one family is left in Varanasi who can paint after the old
style yet. One of them has painted a whole hunting scene on a pea,
perfect in detail and action! </p>
<!--'Volume 5 Page 175'-->
<p>I hope Okakura will come to this city on his return and be
this gentleman's guest and see a bit of what is left. </p>
<p>Niranjan has gone with Mr. Okakura, and as he is a Japanese,
they don't object to his going into any temple. It seems that the
Tibetans and the other Northern Buddhists have been coming here to
worship Shiva all along. </p>
<p>They allowed him to touch the sign of Shiva and worship. Mrs.
Annie Besant tried once, but, poor woman, although she bared her feet,
put on a Sari, and humiliated herself to the dust before the priests,
she was not admitted even into the compound of the temple. The
Buddhists are not considered non-Hindus in any of our great temples. My
plans are not settled; I may shift from this place very soon. </p>
<p>Shivananda and the boys send you all their welcome, regards,
and love. </p>
<p>I am, as ever, your most affectionate son. </p>

<p>DEAR DHIRÂ MÂTÂ, (Mrs. Ole Bull.) </p>
<p>. . . In my opinion, a race must first cultivate a great
respect for motherhood, through the sanctification and inviolability of
marriage, before it can attain to the ideal of perfect chastity. The
Roman Catholics and the Hindus, holding marriage sacred and inviolate,
have produced great chaste men and women of immense power. To the Arab,
marriage is a contract or a forceful possession, to be dissolved at
will, and we do not find there the development of the idea of the
virgin or the Brahmachârin. Modern Buddhism &#8212; having fallen among races
who had not yet come up to the evolution of marriage &#8212; has made a
travesty of monasticism. So until there is developed in Japan a great
and sacred ideal about marriage (apart from mutual attraction and
love), I do not see how there can be great monks and nuns. As you have
come to see that the glory of life is chastity, so my eyes also have
been opened to the necessity of this great sanctification for the vast
majority, in order that a few lifelong chaste powers may be produced. .

<p>RESPECTED SIR, </p>
<p>I have received the two books sent by you and am filled with
joy to read your wonderfully affectionate letter which betokens your
broad, generous heart. No doubt, it is due to good merit of my previous
births that you show, sir, so much kindness to a mendicant like me who
lives on begging. By sending your gift of the ""Vedanta"", you have laid
under lifelong obligation not only myself but the whole group of Shri
Ramakrishna's Sannyasins. They all bow down to you in respect. It is
not for my own sake alone that I asked of you the copy of Pânini's
grammar; a good deal of study, in fact, is given to Sanskrit scriptures
in this Math. The Vedas may well be said to have fallen quite out of
vogue in Bengal. Many here in this Math are conversant with Sanskrit,
and they have a mind to master the Samhitâ portions of the Vedas. They
are of opinion that what has to be done
<!--'Volume 6 Page 203'-->must be done to a finish. So,
believing that a full measure of proficiency in the Vedic language is
impossible without first mastering Panini's grammar, which is the best
available for the purpose, a copy of the latter was felt to be a
necessity. The grammatical work <i>Mugdhabodha</i>, which
we studied in our boyhood, is superior in many respects to <i>Laghukaumudi</i>.
You are yourself, however, a deeply learned man and, therefore, the
best judge we can have in this matter. So if you consider the <i>Ashtâdhyâyi</i>
(Panini's) to be the most suitable in our case, you will lay us under a
debt of lifelong gratitude by sending the same (provided you feel it
convenient and feel so inclined). This Math is not wanting in men of
perseverance, talent, and penetrative intellect. I may hope that by the
grace of our Master, they will acquire in a short time Panini's system
and then succeed in restoring the Vedas to Bengal. I beg to send you
two photographs of my revered Master and two parts of some of his
teachings as given in his homely style compiled, and published by a
certain gentleman &#8212; hoping you will give us the pleasure of your
acceptance. My health is now much improved, and I expect the blessings
of meeting you within two or three months. . . .&nbsp; </p>

RESPECTED SIR,

I have received the two books sent by you and am filled with joy to read your wonderfully affectionate letter which betokens your broad, generous heart. No doubt, it is due to good merit of my previous births that you show, sir, so much kindness to a mendicant like me who lives on begging. By sending your gift of the ""Vedanta"", you have laid under lifelong obligation not only myself but the whole group of Shri Ramakrishna's Sannyasins. They all bow down to you in respect. It is not for my own sake alone that I asked of you the copy of Pânini's grammar; a good deal of study, in fact, is given to Sanskrit scriptures in this Math. The Vedas may well be said to have fallen quite out of vogue in Bengal. Many here in this Math are conversant with Sanskrit, and they have a mind to master the Samhitâ portions of the Vedas. They are of opinion that what has to be donemust be done to a finish. So, believing that a full measure of proficiency in the Vedic language is impossible without first mastering Panini's grammar, which is the best available for the purpose, a copy of the latter was felt to be a necessity. The grammatical workMugdhabodha, which we studied in our boyhood, is superior in many respects toLaghukaumudi. You are yourself, however, a deeply learned man and, therefore, the best judge we can have in this matter. So if you consider theAshtâdhyâyi(Panini's) to be the most suitable in our case, you will lay us under a debt of lifelong gratitude by sending the same (provided you feel it convenient and feel so inclined). This Math is not wanting in men of perseverance, talent, and penetrative intellect. I may hope that by the grace of our Master, they will acquire in a short time Panini's system and then succeed in restoring the Vedas to Bengal. I beg to send you two photographs of my revered Master and two parts of some of his teachings as given in his homely style compiled, and published by a certain gentleman — hoping you will give us the pleasure of your acceptance. My health is now much improved, and I expect the blessings of meeting you within two or three months. . . .","Yours etc.,

During his first year in the Himalayas, he could not secure permission
to enter Tibet, but he got it the next year. The Lamas love him much,
and he had picked up the Tibetan language. He says the Lamas form
ninety per cent of the population, but they mostly practice Tântrika
forms of worship. The country is intensely cold &#8212; eatables there are
scarcely any &#8212; only dried meat; and Gangadhar had to travel and live on

<p>It pleased me highly to know all the news in your letter
yesterday. You have asked me to request Gangadhar to write to you, but
I see no chance thereof, for though they are sending us letters, they
do not stop anywhere for more than two or three days and therefore do
not receive any of ours. </p>
<p>Some relative of my former life (The life he has renounced)
has purchased a bungalow at Simultala (near Baidyanath). The place
being credited with a healthy climate, I stayed there for some time.
But the summer heat growing excessive, I<!--'Volume 6 Page 206'-->
had an attack of acute diarrhoea, and I have just fled away from the

<p>Words fail to describe how strong is the desire in my mind to
go to Varanasi and have my soul blessed by meeting you and sojourning
with you in good converse, but everything rests on His will! I wonder
what linking of heart existed between us, sir, from some previous
incarnation that, receiving as I do the love and affection of not a few
men of wealth and position in this city of Calcutta, I am apt to feel
so much bored by their society, while only through one day's interview
my heart felt charmed enough to accept you as a near relative and
friend in spiritual life! One reason is that you are a favoured servant

six or seven years of my life have been full of constant struggles with
hindrances and obstacles of all sorts. I have been vouchsafed the ideal
Shâstra; I have seen the ideal man; and yet fail myself to get on with
anything to the end &#8212; this is my profound misery. </p>

it is going very hard with them &#8212; they even have to go fasting at

<!--'Volume 6 Page 208'-->
<p>2. In most cases where Shankaracharya quotes Smriti in his
commentary on the <i>Vedânta-Sutras</i>, he cites the
authority of the Mahâbhârata. But seeing that we find clear proofs
about caste being based on qualification both in the Bhishmaparva of
the Mahabharata and in the stories there of the Ajagara and of Umâ and
Maheshvara, has he made any mention in his writings of this fact? </p>
<p>3. The doctrine of caste in the <i>Purusha-Sukta</i>
of the Vedas does not make it hereditary &#8212; so what are those instances
in the Vedas where caste has been made a matter of hereditary
transmission? </p>
<p>4. The Achârya could not adduce any proof from the Vedas to
the effect that the Shudra should not study the Vedas. He only quotes
""&#2351;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2375;&#2365;&#2344;&#2357;&#2325;&#2381;&#2354;&#2371;&#2346;&#2381;&#2340;&#2307;"" (""The
Shudra is not conceived of as a performer of Yajna or Vedic
sacrifices."") (Tai. Samhita, VII. i. 1. 6) to maintain that when he is
not entitled to perform Yajnas, he has neither any right to study the
Upanishads and the like. But the same Acharya contends with reference
to ""&#2309;&#2341;&#2366;&#2340;&#2379; &#2348;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2381;&#2350;&#2332;&#2367;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2366;&#2360;&#2366;"",
(""Now then commences hence the inquiry about Brahman."") (<i>Vedânta-Sutras</i>,
I. i. 1) that the word &#2309;&#2341; here does not
mean ""subsequent to the study of the Vedas"", because it is contrary to
proof that the study of the Upanishad is not permissible without the
previous study of the Vedic Mantras and <i>Brâhmanas</i>
and because there is no intrinsic sequence between the Vedic
Karma-kânda and Vedic Janâna-kânda. It is evident, therefore, that one
may attain to the knowledge of Brahman without having studied the
ceremonial parts of the Vedas. So if there is no sequence between the
sacrificial practices and Jnana, why does the Acharya contradict his
own statement when it is a case of the Shudras, by inserting the clause
""by force of the same logic""? Why should the Shudra not study the
Upanishad? </p>
<p>I am mailing you, sir, a book named <i>Imitation of

<i>17th Aug., 1889.</i></p>
<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>You have expressed embarrassment in your last favour for being
addressed reverentially. But the blame attaches<!--'Volume 6 Page 210'-->
not to me but to your own excellent qualities. I wrote in one letter
before that from the way I feel attracted by your lofty virtues, it
seems we had some affinity from previous births. I make no distinction
as to householder or Sannyasin in this, that for all time my head shall
bend low in reverence wherever I see greatness, broadness of heart, and
holiness &#8212; Shântih! Shântih! Shântih! My prayer is that among the many
people embracing Sannyâsa nowadays, greedy of honour, posing
renunciation for the sake of a living, and fallen off from the ideal on
both sides, may one in a lakh at least become high-souled like you! To
you my Brahmin fellow-disciples who have heard of your noble virtues
tender their best prostrations. </p>
<p>About one amongst my several questions to which you sent your
replies, my wrong idea is corrected. For this I shall remain indebted
to you for ever. Another of these questions was: Whether Acharya
Shankara gives any conclusion regarding caste based on Gunas as
mentioned in Puranâs like the Mahabharata. If he does, where is it to
be found? I have no doubt that according to the ancient view in this
country, caste was hereditary, and it cannot also be doubted that
sometimes the Shudras used to be oppressed more than the helots among
the Spartans and the negroes among the Americans! As for myself, I have
no partiality for any party in this caste question, because I know it
is a social law and is based on diversity of Guna and Karma. It also
means grave harm if one bent on going beyond Guna and Karma cherishes
in mind any caste distinctions. In these matters, I have got some
settled ideas through the grace of my Guru but, if I come to know of
your views, I may just confirm some points or rectify others in them.
One doesn't have honey dripping unless one pokes at the hive &#8212; so I
shall put you some more questions; and looking upon me as ignorant and
as a boy, please give proper replies without taking any offence. </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 211'-->
<p>1. Is the Mukti, which the <i>Vedanta-Sutras</i>
speaks of, one and the same with the Nirvana of the Avadhuta-Gitâ and
other texts? </p>
<p>2. What is really meant by Nirvana if, according to the
aphorism, ""Without the function of creating <a name=""txt2""></a>etc.""<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 211'-->
(ibid., IV. iv. 7), none can attain to the fullest Godhead? </p>
<p>3. Chaitanya-deva is said to have told Sârvabhauma at Puri, ""I
understand the Sutras (aphorisms) of Vyasa, they are dualistic; but the
commentator makes them, monistic, which I don't understand."" Is this
true? Tradition says, Chaitanya-deva had a dispute with Prakashananda
Sarasvati on the point, and Chaitanya-deva won. One commentary by
Chaitanya-deva was rumoured to have been existing in Prakashananda's
Math. </p>
<p>4. In the Tantra, Acharya Shankara has been called a
crypto-Buddhist; views expressed in <i>Prajnâparamitâ</i>,
the Buddhist Mâhâyana book, perfectly tally with the Vedantic views
propounded by the Acharya. The author of <i>Panchadashi</i>
also says, ""What we call Brahman is the same truth as the Shunya of the
Buddhist."" What does all this mean? </p>
<p>5. Why has no foundation for the authority of the Vedas been
adduced in the <i>Vedanta-Sutras</i>? First, it has been
said<!--'Volume 6 Page 212'--> that the Vedas are the
authority for the existence of God, and then it has been argued that
the authority for the Vedas is the text: ""It is the breath of God.""
Now, is this statement not vitiated by what in Western logic is called
an argument in a circle? </p>
<p>6. The Vedanta requires of us faith, for conclusiveness cannot
be reached by mere argumentation. Then why, has the slightest flaw,
detected in the position of the schools of Sânkhya and Nyâya, been
overwhelmed with a fusillade of dialectics? In whom, moreover, are we
to put our faith? Everybody seems to be mad over establishing his own
view; if, according to Vyasa, even the great Muni Kapila, ""the greatest
among perfected <a name=""txt3""></a>souls"",<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn3"">3</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 212'-->
is himself deeply involved in error, then who would say that Vyasa may
not be so involved in a greater measure? Did Kapila fail to understand
the Vedas? </p>
<p>7. According to the Nyaya, ""Shabda or Veda (the criterion of
truth), is the word of those who have realised the highest""; so the
Rishis as such are omniscient. Then how are they proved, according to
the<i> Surya-siddhânta</i>, to be ignorant of such simple
astronomical truths? How can we accept their intelligence as the refuge
to ferry us across the ocean of transmigratory existence, seeing that
they speak of the earth as triangular, of the serpent Vâsuki as the
support of the earth and so on? </p>
<p>8. If in His acts of creation God is dependent on good and
evil Karmas, then what does it avail us to worship Him? There is a fine
song of Nareshchandra, where occurs the following: ""If what lies in
one's destiny is to happen anyhow, O Mother, then what good all this
invoking by the holy name of Durgâ?"" </p>
<p>9. True, it is improper to hold many texts on the same<!--'Volume 6 Page 213'-->
subject to be contradicted by one or two. But why then are the
long-continued customs of <a name=""txt4""></a>Madhuparka<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn4"">4</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 213'-->
and the like repealed by one or two such texts as, ""The horse
sacrifice, the cow sacrifice, Sannyasa, meat-offerings in Shrâddha"",
etc.? If the Vedas are eternal, then what are the meaning and
justification of such specifications as ""this rule of Dharma is for the
age of Dvâpara,"" ""this for the age of Kali"", and so forth? </p>
<p>10. The same God who gives out the Vedas becomes Buddha again
to annul them; which of these dispensations is to be obeyed? Which of
these remains authoritative, the earlier or the later one? </p>
<p>11. The Tantra says, in the Kali-Yuga the Veda-Mantras are
futile. So which behest of God, the Shiva, is to be followed? </p>
<p>12. Vyasa makes out in the <i>Vedanta-Sutras</i>
that it is wrong to worship the tetrad of divine manifestation,
Vâsudeva, Sankarshana, etc., and again that very Vyasa expatiates on
the great merits of that worship in the <i>Bhâgavata</i>!
Is this Vyasa a madman? </p>
<p>I have many doubts besides these, and, hoping to have them
dispelled from my mind through your kindness, I shall lay them before
you in future. Such questions cannot be all set forth except in a
personal interview; neither can as much satisfaction be obtained as one
expects to. So I have a mind to lay before you all these facts when
presenting myself to you, which I expect will be very soon, by the
grace of the Guru. </p>
<p>I have heard it said that without inner progress in the<!--'Volume 6 Page 214'-->
practice of religion, no true conclusion can be reached concerning
these matters, simply by means of reasoning; but satisfaction, at least
to some extent, seems to be necessary at the outset. </p>

Such questions cannot be all set forth except in a personal interview; neither can as much satisfaction be obtained as one expects to. So I have a mind to lay before you all these facts when presenting myself to you, which I expect will be very soon, by the grace of the Guru.

I have heard it said that without inner progress in thepractice of religion, no true conclusion can be reached concerning these matters, simply by means of reasoning; but satisfaction, at least to some extent, seems to be necessary at the outset.","Yours etc.,VIVEKANANDA.",,1139,2,0

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>Some days ago I received your two kind letters. I am very much
pleased to find in you a wonderful harmony of Jnana and Bhakti. Your
advice to me to give up arguing and disputing is very true indeed, and
that is really the goal of life for the individual &#8212; ""Sundered are the
knots of the heart, torn off are all his doubts, and the seeds of his
Karma wear off, when the sight of the Transcendent One is gained.""
(Mundakonapanishad, II. ii. 8.) But then, as my Master used to say,
when a pitcher is being filled (by immersion), it gurgles, but when
full, it is noiseless; know my condition to be the same. Within two or
three weeks perhaps, I shall be able to meet you &#8212; may God fulfil that
wish!&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have not heard from you for a long time, I hope you are
doing well in body and mind. Two of my brother disciples are shortly
leaving for Varanasi. One is Rakhal by name, the other is Subodh. The
first-named was beloved of my Master and used to stay much with him.

him up on the way, taking him to be a spy of the foreigners. Eventually
some Lamas kindly set him free. We obtain this news from a Tibet-going

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I have all particulars from your letter; and from Rakhal's
which followed, I came to know of your meeting. I have received the
pamphlet written by you. A kind of scientific Advaitism has been
spreading in Europe ever since the theory of the conservation of energy
was discovered, but all that is Parinâmavâda, evolution by real
modification. It is good you have shown the difference between this and
Shankara's Vivartavâda (progressive manifestation by unreal
superimposition). I can't appreciate your citing Spencer's parody on
the German transcendentalists; he himself is fed much on their doles.
It is doubtful whether your opponent Gough understands his Hegel
sufficiently. Anyway, your rejoinder is very pointed and
thrashing.&nbsp; </p>

me that a brother-disciple, Yogen by name, had been attacked with
smallpox after arriving here from a pilgrimage to Chitrakuta,
Omkarnath, etc., and so I came to this place to nurse him. He has now
completely recovered. Some Bengali gentlemen here are of a greatly
pious and loving disposition. They are very lovingly taking care of me,
and their importunate desire is that I should stay here during the
month of Mâgha<!--'Volume 6 Page 217'--> (Jan.-Feb.)
keeping the Kalpa vow. (Special ablutions and worship regularly
performed in that holy confluence &#8212; a very solemn and sacred practice.)
But my mind is very keenly harping on the name of Varanasi and is quite
agog to see you. Yes, I am going to try my best to slip away and avoid
their importunities in a day or two and betake myself to the holy realm
of the Lord of Varanasi. If one of my monastic brother-disciples,
Achyutananda Sarasvati by name, calls on you to enquire of me, please
tell him I am soon coming to Varanasi. He is indeed a very good man and
learned. I was obliged to leave him behind at Bankipore. Are Rakhal and
Subodh still there in Varanasi? Please inquire and inform me whether
the Kumbha fair this year is going to be held at Hardwar or not. </p>
<p>Many a man of wisdom, of piety, many a Sâdhu (holy man) and

by them, but ""&#2349;&#2367;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2352;&#2369;&#2330;&#2367;&#2352;&#2381;&#2361;&#2367; &#2354;&#2379;&#2325;&#2366;&#2307; &#8212; Men are of varying tastes"" &#8212; <i>Raghuvamsham</i>).

your change to Baidyanath was that it would be impossible for a man of

for you, and if you have deferred it so long simply to select a cheaper
place and that sort of thing, it is certainly a matter of regret. . . .
Baidyanath is excellent so far as the air is concerned, but the water
is not good, it upsets the stomach. I used to suffer from acidity every
day. I have already written you a letter; have you got it, or finding
it a bearing letter, have you left it to its fate? In my opinion, if
you <i>have</i> to go away for a change, the sooner the
better. But, pardon me, you have a tendency to expect that everything

GORABAZAR, GHAZIPUR, <br>
<i>21st Jan., 1890.</i></p>
<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I reached Ghazipur three days ago. Here I am putting up in the
house of Babu Satish Chandra Mukherji, a friend of my early age. The
place is very pleasant. Close by flows the Ganga, but bathing there is
troublesome, for there is no regular path, and it is hard work wading
through sands. Babu Ishan Chandra Mukherji, my friend's father, that
noble-hearted man of whom I spoke to you, is here. Today he is leaving
for Varanasi whence he will proceed to Calcutta. I again had a great
mind to go over to Kashi, but the object of my coming here, namely, an
interview with the Bâbâji (Pavhâri Bâbâ, the great saint.), has not yet
been realised, and. hence the delay of a few days becomes necessary.
Everything here appears good. The people are all gentlemen, but very
much Westernised; and it is a pity I am so thoroughly against every
affectation of the Western idea. Only my friend very little affects
such ideals. What a frippery civilisation is it indeed that the
foreigners have brought over here! What a materialistic illusion have
they created! May Vishvanâtha save these weak-hearted! After seeing
Babaji, I shall send you a detailed account.</p>

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>It is so very difficult to meet the Babaji. He does not step
out of his home; and, when willing to speak at all, he just comes near
the door to speak from inside. I have come away with having just a view
of his garden-house with chimneys tapering above and encircled by high
walls &#8212; no means of admittance within! People say there are cave-like
rooms within where he dwells; and he only knows what he does there, for
nobody has had a peep. I had to come away one day sorely used up with
waiting and waiting, but shall take my chance again. On Sunday, I leave
for holy Varanasi &#8212; only the Babus here won't let me off; otherwise all
my fancy to see the Babaji has flattened down. I am prepared to be off
today, but anyhow, I am leaving on Sunday. What of your plan of going
to Hrishikesh? </p>

have obtained an interview with Babaji. A great sage indeed! &#8212; It is
all very wonderful, and in this atheistic age, a towering
representation of marvellous power born of Bhakti and Yoga! I have
sought refuge in his grace; and he has given me hope &#8212; a thing very few
may be fortunate enough to obtain. It is Babaji's wish that I stay on
for some days here, and he would do

saint's bidding I shall remain here for some time. No doubt, this will
give you also much pleasure. I don't mention them in a letter, but the

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I feel very happy to hear from you just now. Apparently in his
features, the Babaji is a Vaishnava the embodiment, so to speak, of
Yoga, Bhakti, and humility. His dwelling has walls on all sides with a
few doors in them. Inside these walls, there is one long underground
burrow wherein he lays himself up in Samâdhi. He talks to others only
when he comes out of the hole. Nobody knows what he eats, and so they
call him Pavhâri (One living on air.) Bâbâ. Once he did not come out of
the hole for five years, and people thought he had given up the body.
But now again he is out. But this time he does not show himself to
people and talks from behind the door. Such sweetness in speech I have
never come across! He does not give a direct reply to questions but
says, ""What does this servant know?"" But then fire comes out as the
talking goes on. On my pressing him very much he said, ""Favour me
highly by staying here some days."" But he never speaks in this way; so
from this I understood he meant to reassure me and whenever I am
importunate, he asks me to stay on. So I wait in hope. He is a learned
man no doubt but
<!--'Volume 6 Page 222'-->nothing in the line betrays
itself. He performs scriptural ceremonials, for from the full-moon day
to the last day of the month, sacrificial oblations go on. So it is
sure, he is not retiring into the hole during this period. How can I
ask his permission, (Evidently for a proposed visit to the saint by the
correspondent, Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi.) for he never gives a
direct reply; he goes on multiplying such expressions as ""this
servant"", ""my fortune"", and so on. If you yourself have a mind, then
come sharp on receipt of this note. Or after his passing away, the
keenest regret will be left in your mind. In two days you may return
after an interview &#8212; I mean a talk with him <i>ab intra</i>.
My friend Satish Babu will receive you most warmly. So, do come up
directly you receive this; I shall meanwhile let Babaji know of
you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I am in anxiety to hear of your illness. I am also having some
sort of a pain in the loins which, being aggravated of late, gives much
trouble. For two days I could not go out to meet Babaji, and so a man
came from him to inquire about me. For this reason, I go today. I shall
convey your countless compliments. ""Fire comes out"" that is, a
wonderful devotion to Guru and resignation are revealed; and such
amazing endurance
<!--'Volume 6 Page 223'-->and humility I have never seen.
Whatever good things I may come by, sure, you have your share in
them.&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I wrote a letter to brother Gangadhar asking him to stop his
wandering and settle down somewhere and to send me an account of the
various Sadhus he had come across in Tibet and their ways and customs.
I enclose the reply that came from him. Brother Kali is having repeated
attacks of fever at Hrishikesh. I have sent him a wire from this place.
So if from the reply I find I am wanted by him, I shall be obliged to
start direct for Hrishikesh from this place, otherwise I am coming to
you in a day or two. Well, you may smile, sir, to see me weaving all
this web of Mâyâ &#8212; and that is no doubt
<!--'Volume 6 Page 224'-->the fact. But then there is the
chain of iron, and there is the chain of gold. Much good comes of the
latter; and it drops off by itself when all the good is reaped. The
sons of my Master are indeed the great objects of my service, and here
alone I feel I have some duty left for me. Perhaps I shall send brother
Kali down to Allahabad or somewhere else, as convenient. At your feet
are laid a hundred and one faults of mine &#8212; ""I am as thy son, so guide
me who have taken refuge in thee."" (An adaptation from the Gitâ, II.

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>Your kind letter comes to hand just now. You know not, sir, I
am a very soft-natured man in spite of the stern Vedantic views I hold.
And this proves to be my undoing. At the slightest touch I give myself
away; for howsoever I may try to think only of my own good, I slip off
in spite of myself to think of other peoples' interests. This time it
was with a very stern resolve that I set out to pursue my own good, but
I had to run off at the news of the illness of a brother at Allahabad!
And now comes this news from Hrishikesh, and my mind has run off with
me there. I have wired to Sharat, hut no reply yet &#8212; a nice
<!--'Volume 6 Page 230'-->place indeed to delay even
telegrams so much! The lumbago obstinately refuses to leave me, and the
pain is very great. For the last few days I haven't been able to go to
see Pavhariji, but out of his kindness he sends every day for my
report. But now I see the whole matter is inverted in its bearings!
While I myself have come, a beggar, at his door, he turns round and
wants to learn of me! This saint perhaps is not yet perfected &#8212; too
much of rites, vows, observances, and too much of self-concealment. The
ocean in its fullness cannot be contained within its shores, I am sure.
So it is not good, I have decided not to disturb this Sâdhu (holy man)
for nothing, and very soon I shall ask leave of him to go. No help, you
see; Providence has dealt me my death to make me so tender! Babaji does
not let me off, and Gagan Babu (whom probably you know &#8212; an upright,
pious, and kindhearted man) does not let me off. If the wire in reply
requires my leaving this place, I go; if not, I am coming to you at
Varanasi in a few days. I am not going to let you off&nbsp; &#8212; I
must take you to Hrishikesh &#8212; no excuse or objections will do. What are
you saying about difficulties there of keeping clean? Lack of water in
the hills or lack of room!! Tirthas (places of pilgrimage) and
Sannyasins of the Kali-Yuga &#8212; you know what they are. Spend money and
the owners of temples will fling away the installed god to make room
for you; so no anxiety about a resting-place! No trouble to face there,
I say; the summer heat has set in there now, I believe, though not that
degree of it as you find at Varanasi &#8212; so much the better. Always the
nights are quite cool there, from which good sleep is almost a
certainty. </p>
<p>Why do you get frightened so much? I stand guarantee that you
shall return home safe and that you shall have no trouble anywhere. It
is my experience that in this British realm no fakir or householder
gets into any trouble. </p>
<p>Is it a mere idle fancy of mine that between us there
<!--'Volume 6 Page 231'-->is some connection from previous
birth? Just see how one letter from you sweeps away all my resolution
and, I bend my steps towards Varanasi leaving all matters behind! . . .
</p>
<p>I have written again to brother Gangadhar and have asked him
this time to return to the Math. If he comes, he will meet you. How is
the climate at Varanasi now? By my stay here I have been cured of all
other symptoms of malaria, only the pain in the loins makes me frantic;
day and night it is aching and chafes me very much. I know not how I
shall climb up the hills. I find wonderful endurance in Babaji, and
that's why I am begging something of him; but no inkling of the mood to
give, only receiving and receiving! So I also fly off.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours etc., </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p><br>
PS. To no big person am I going any longer &#8212; </p>
<p>""Remain, O mind, within yourself, go not to anybody else's
door; whatever you seek, you shall obtain sitting at your ease, only
seek for it in the privacy of your heart. There is the supreme
Treasure, the philosophers' stone and He can give whatever you ask for;
for countless gems, O mind, lie strewn about the portals of His abode.
He is the wishing-stone that confers boons at the mere thought."" Thus
says the poet Kamalâkânta. </p>
<p>So now the great conclusion is that Ramakrishna has no peer;
nowhere else in this world exists that unprecedented perfection, that
wonderful kindness for all that does not stop to justify itself, that
intense sympathy for man in bondage. Either he must be the Avatâra as
he himself used to say, or else the ever-perfected divine man whom the
Vedanta speaks of as the free one who assumes a body for the good of
humanity. This is my conviction sure and certain; and the worship of
such a divine man has been referred to by Patanjali in the
<!--'Volume 6 Page 232'-->aphorism: ""Or the goal may be
attained by meditating on a saint."" (Patanjali's aphorism has ""Ishvara""
in place of ""saint"". Nârada has an aphorism which runs thus : Bhakti
(Supreme Love) is attainable chiefly through the grace of a saint, or
by a bit of Divine Grace.) </p>
<p>Never during his life did he refuse a single prayer of mine;
millions of offences has he forgiven me; such great love even my
parents never had for me. There is no poetry, no exaggeration in all
this. It is the bare truth and every disciple of his knows it. In times
of great danger, great temptation, I wept in extreme agony with the
prayer, ""O God, do save me,"" but no response came from anybody; but
this wonderful saint, or Avatara, or anything else he may be, came to
know of all my affliction through his powers of insight into human
hearts and lifted it off &#8212; in spite of my desire to the contrary &#8212;
after getting me brought to his presence. If the soul be deathless, and
so, if he still lives, I pray to trim again and again: ""O Bhagavan
Ramakrishna, thou infinite ocean of mercy and my only refuge, do
graciously fulfil the desires of my esteemed friend, who is every inch
a great man."" May he impart to you all good, he whom alone I have found
in this world to be like an ocean of unconditioned mercy! Shântih,
Shântih, Shântih. </p>

I know not how I shall climb up the hills. I find wonderful endurance in Babaji, and that's why I am begging something of him; but no inkling of the mood to give, only receiving and receiving! So I also fly off.

PS. To no big person am I going any longer —

""Remain, O mind, within yourself, go not to anybody else's door; whatever you seek, you shall obtain sitting at your ease, only seek for it in the privacy of your heart. There is the supreme Treasure, the philosophers' stone and He can give whatever you ask for; for countless gems, O mind, lie strewn about the portals of His abode. He is the wishing-stone that confers boons at the mere thought."" Thus says the poet Kamalâkânta.

So now the great conclusion is that Ramakrishna has no peer; nowhere else in this world exists that unprecedented perfection, that wonderful kindness for all that does not stop to justify itself, that intense sympathy for man in bondage. Either he must be the Avatâra as he himself used to say, or else the ever-perfected divine man whom the Vedanta speaks of as the free one who assumes a body for the good of humanity. This is my conviction sure and certain; and the worship of such a divine man has been referred to by Patanjali in theaphorism: ""Or the goal may be attained by meditating on a saint."" (Patanjali's aphorism has ""Ishvara"" in place of ""saint"". Nârada has an aphorism which runs thus : Bhakti (Supreme Love) is attainable chiefly through the grace of a saint, or by a bit of Divine Grace.)

Never during his life did he refuse a single prayer of mine; millions of offences has he forgiven me; such great love even my parents never had for me. There is no poetry, no exaggeration in all this. It is the bare truth and every disciple of his knows it. In times of great danger, great temptation, I wept in extreme agony with the prayer, ""O God, do save me,"" but no response came from anybody; but this wonderful saint, or Avatara, or anything else he may be, came to know of all my affliction through his powers of insight into human hearts and lifted it off — in spite of my desire to the contrary — after getting me brought to his presence. If the soul be deathless, and so, if he still lives, I pray to trim again and again: ""O Bhagavan Ramakrishna, thou infinite ocean of mercy and my only refuge, do graciously fulfil the desires of my esteemed friend, who is every inch a great man."" May he impart to you all good, he whom alone I have found in this world to be like an ocean of unconditioned mercy! Shântih, Shântih, Shântih.

<p>Very glad to receive your letter yesterday. I am at present
staying with the wonderful Yogi and devotee of this place, called
Pavhariji. He never comes out of his room and holds conversations with
people from behind the door. Inside the room there is a pit in which he
lives. It is rumoured that he remains in a state of Samadhi for months
together. His fortitude is most wonderful. Our Bengal is the land of
Bhakti and of Jnana, where Yoga is scarcely so much as talked of even.
What little there is, is but the queer breathing exercises of the
Hatha-Yoga &#8212; which is nothing but a kind of gymnastics. Therefore I am
staying with this wonderful Raja-Yogi &#8212; and he has given me some hopes,
too. There is a beautiful bungalow in a small garden belonging to a
gentleman here; I mean to stay there. The garden is quite close to
Babaji's cottage. A brother of the Babaji stays there to look after the
comforts of the Sadhus, and I shall have my Bhikshâ at his place.
Hence, with a view to seeing to the end of this fun, I give up for the
present my plan of going to the hills. For the last two months I have
had an attack of lumbago in the waist, which also<!--'Volume 6 Page 234'-->
makes it impossible to climb the hills now. Therefore let me wait and
see what Babaji will give me. </p>
<p>My motto is to learn whatever good things I may come across
anywhere. This leads many friends to think that it will take away from
my devotion to the Guru. These ideas I count as those of lunatics and
bigots. For all Gurus are one and are fragments and radiations of God,
the Universal Guru. </p>
<p>If you come to Ghazipur, you have but to inquire at Satish

Pavhari Baba is so well-known a person here that everyone will inform

everything in detail in my last letter. You start immediately on
receipt of this. I know the route to Tibet via Nepal that you have
spoken of. As they don't allow anyone to enter Tibet easily, so they
don't allow anybody to go anywhere in Nepal, except Katmandu, its
capital, and one or two places of pilgrimage. But a friend of mine is
now a tutor to His Highness the Maharaja of Nepal, and a teacher in his
school, from whom I have it that when the Nepal government send their
subsidy to China, they send it via Lhasa. A Sadhu contrived in that way
to go to Lhasa, China, Manchuria, and even to the holy seat of Târâ
Devi in north China. We, too, can visit with dignity and respect Tibet,
Lhasa, China, and all, if that friend of mine tries to arrange it. You
therefore start immediately for Ghazipur. After a few days' stay here
with the Babaji, I shall correspond with my friend, and, everything
arranged, I shall certainly go to Tibet via Nepal. </p>
<p>You have to get down at Dildarnagar to come to Ghazipur. It is
three or four stations from Moghul Sarai. I would have sent you the
passage if I could have collected it here; so you get it together and
come. Gagan Babu with whom I am putting up, is an exceedingly
courteous, noble, and generous-minded man. No sooner did he come to
know of Kali's illness than he sent him the passage at Hrishikesh; he
has besides spent much on my account. Under the circumstances it would
be violating a Sannyasin's duty to tax him for the passage to Kashmir,
and I desist from it. You collect the fare and start as soon as you
receive this letter. Let the craze for visiting Amarnath be put back
for the present.&nbsp; </p>

away today. I have asked brother Gangadhar to come here; and if he
comes, we go over to you together. For some special reasons, I shall
continue to stay in secret in a village some distance from this place,

to which I could not reply to your letter so long. Brother Gangadhar is
very likely to come, otherwise the reply to my note would have reached
me. Brother Abhedananda is putting up with Doctor Priya at Varanasi.
Another brother of mine had been with me, but has left for
Abhedananda's place. The news of his arrival has not yet been received,
and, his health being bad, I am rather anxious for his sake. I have
behaved very cruelly towards him &#8212; that is, I have harassed him much to
make him leave my company. There's no help, you see; I am so very
weak-hearted, so much overmastered by the distractions of love! Bless
me that I may harden. What shall I say to you about the condition of my
mind! Oh, it is as if the hell-fire is burning there day and night!
Nothing, nothing could I do yet! And this life seems muddled away in
vain; I feel quite helpless as to what to do! The Babaji throws out
honeyed words and keeps me from leaving. Ah, what shall I say? I am
committing hundreds of offenses against you &#8212; please excuse them as so
many misdoings of a man driven mad with mental agonies. Abhedananda is
suffering from dysentery. I shall be very much obliged if you will
kindly inquire about his condition and send him down to our Math in
case he wants to go there with our brother who has come from here. My
Gurubhais must be thinking me very cruel and selfish. Oh, what can I
do? Who will see
<!--'Volume 6 Page 237'-->deep down into my mind? Who will

<p>MY DEAR KALI (ABHEDANANDA), </p>
<p>Glad to receive your letter as well as Pramada Babu's and
Baburam's (Premananda's). I am doing pretty well here. You have
expressed a desire to see me. I too have a similar longing, and it is
this that makes me afraid of going. Moreover, the Babaji forbids me to
do so. I shall try to go on a few days' leave from him. But there is
this fear that by so doing I shall be drawn up to the hills by the
attraction I have for Hrishikesh, and it will be very difficult to
shake it off, specially for one weak-minded, you see, like myself. The
attack of lumbago, too, will not leave me on any account &#8212; a
botheration! But then I am getting used to it. Please convey my
countless salutations to Pramada Babu; his is a friendship which
greatly benefits both my mind and body. And I am particularly indebted
to him. Things will turn up some way, anyhow. </p>

<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I could not write to you because of various distractions and a
relapse of fever. Glad to learn from Abhedananda's letter that you are
doing well. Gangadhar (Akhandananda) has probably arrived at Varanasi
by this time. King Death happens here to be casting into his jaws these
days many of our friends and own people, hence I am very much taken up.
Perhaps no letter for me has arrived there from Nepal. I know not how
and when Vishvanâtha (the Lord of Kashi) would choose to vouchsafe some
rest to me. Directly the hot weather relaxes a little, I am off from
this place, but I am still at a loss where to go. Do please pray for me
to Vishvanatha that He may grant me strength. You are a devotee, and I
beseech you with the Lord's words coming to my mind, ""Those who are the
devoted ones to My devotees, are indeed considered the best of My
devotees.""&nbsp; </p>

<p class=""right"">57, RAMAKANTA BOSE'S STREET, <br>
BAGHBAZAR, CALCUTTA, <br>
<i>26th May, 1890</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, </p>
<p>I write this to you while caught in a vortex of many untoward
circumstances and great agitation of mind; with a prayer to
Vishvanatha, please think of the propriety and possibility, or
otherwise, of all that I set forth below and then oblige me greatly by
a reply. </p>
<p>1. I already told you at the outset that I am Ramakrishna's
slave, having laid my body at his feet ""with Til and Tulasi leaves"", I
cannot disregard his behest. If it is in failure that that great sage
laid down his life after having attained to superhuman heights of
Jnana, Bhakti, Love, and powers, and after having practiced for forty
years stern renunciation, non-attachment, holiness, and great
austerities, then where is there anything for us to count on? So I am
obliged to trust his words as the words of one identified with truth. </p>
<p>2. Now his behest to me was that I should devote myself to the
service of the order of all-renouncing devotees founded by him, and in
this I have to persevere, come what may, being ready to take heaven,
hell, salvation, or anything that may happen to me. </p>
<p>3. His command was that his all-renouncing devotees should
group themselves together, and I am entrusted with seeing to this. Of
course, it matters not if any one of us goes out on visits to this
place or that, but these shall be but visits, while his own opinion was
that absolute homeless wandering suited him alone who was perfected to
the highest point. Before that state, it is proper to settle somewhere
to dive down into practice. When all the ideas of body and the like are
dissolved of themselves, a person may then pursue whatever state comes
<!--'Volume 6 Page 240'-->to him. Otherwise, it is baneful
for a practicing aspirant to be always wandering. </p>
<p>4. So in pursuance cf this his commandment, his group of
Sannyasins are now assembled in a dilapidated house at Baranagore, and
two of his lay disciples, Babu Suresh Chandra Mitra and Babu Balaram
Bose, so long provided for their food and house-rent. </p>
<p>5. For various reasons, the body of Bhagavan Ramakrishna had
to be consigned to fire. There is no doubt that this act was very
blamable. The remains of his ashes are now preserved, and if they be
now properly enshrined somewhere on the banks of the Ganga, I presume
we shall be able in some measure to expiate the sin lying on our head.
These sacred remains, his seat, and his picture are every day
worshipped in our Math in proper form; and it is known to you that a
brother-disciple of mine, of Brahmin parentage, is occupied day and
night with the task. The expenses of the worship used also to be borne
by the two great souls mentioned above. </p>
<p>6. What greater regret can there be than this that no memorial
could yet be raised in this land of Bengal in the very neighbourhood of
the place where he lived his life of Sâdhanâ &#8212; he by whose birth the
race of Bengalees has been sanctified, the land of Bengal has become
hallowed, he who came on earth to save the Indians from the spell of
the worldly glamour of Western culture and who therefore chose most of
his all-renouncing disciples from university men? </p>
<p>7. The two gentlemen mentioned above had a strong desire to
have some land purchased on the banks of the Ganga and see the sacred
remains enshrined on it, with the disciples living there together; and
Suresh Babu had offered a sum of Rs. 1,000 for the purpose, promising
to give more, but for some inscrutable purpose of God he left this
world yesternight! And the news of Balaram Babu's death is already
known to you. </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 241'-->
<p>8. Now there is no knowing as to where his disciples will
stand with his sacred remains and his seat (and you know well, people
here in Bengal are profuse in their professions, but do not stir out an
inch in practice). The disciples are Sannyasins and are ready forthwith
to depart anywhere their way may lie. But I, their servant, am in an
agony of sufferings, and my heart is breaking to think that a small
piece of land could not be had in which to install the remains of
Bhagavan Ramakrishna. </p>
<p>9. It is impossible with a sum of Rs. 1,000 to secure land and
raise a temple near Calcutta. Some such land would at least cost about
five to seven thousands. </p>
<p>10. You remain now the only friend and patron of Shri
Ramakrishna's disciples. In the NorthWestern Province great indeed is
your fame, your position, and your circle of acquaintance. I request
you to consider, if you feel like it, the propriety of your getting the
affair through by raising subscriptions from well-to-do pious men known
to you in your province. If you deem it proper to have some shelter
erected on the banks of the Ganga in Bengal for Bhagavan Ramakrishna's
sacred remains and for his disciples, I shall with your leave report
myself to you, and I have not the slightest qualm to beg from door to
door for this noble cause, for the sake of my Lord and his children.
Please give this proposal your best thoughts with prayers to
Vishvanatha. To my mind, if all these sincere, educated, youthful
Sannyasins of good birth fail to dive up to the ideals of Shri
Ramakrishna owing to want of an abode and help, then alas for our
country! </p>
<p>11. If you ask, ""You are a Sannyasin, so why do you trouble
over these desires?"" &#8212; I would then reply, I am Ramakrishna's servant,
and I am willing even to steal and rob, if by doing so I can perpetuate
his name in the land of his birth and Sâdhanâ (spiritual struggle) and
help even a little his disciples to practice his great ideals. I know
<!--'Volume 6 Page 242'-->you to be my closest in kinship,
and I lay my mind bare to you. I returned to Calcutta for this reason.
I had told you this before I left, and now I leave it to you to do what
you think best. </p>
<p>12. If you argue that it is better to have the plan carried
out in some place like Kashi, my point is, as I have told you, it would
be the greatest pity if the memorial shrine could not be raised in the
land of his birth and Sadhana! The condition of Bengal is pitiable. The
people here cannot even dream what renunciation truly means &#8212; luxury
and sensuality have been so much eating into the vitals of the race!
May God send renunciation and unworldliness into this land! They have
here nothing to speak of, while the people of the North-Western
Province, specially the rich there as I believe, have great zeal in
noble causes like this. Please send me such reply as you think best.
Gangadhar has not yet arrived today, and may do so tomorrow. I am so
eager to see him again. </p>

<i>July 6, 1890</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SHARAT (SARADANANDA) and KRIPANANDA, </p>
<p>Your letters have duly reached us. They say Almora is
healthiest at this time of the year, yet you are taken ill! I hope it
is nothing malarious. . . . </p>
<p>I find Gangadhar the same pliant child with his turbulence
moderated by his wanderings, and with a greater love for us and for our
Lord. He is bold, brave, sincere, and steadfast. The only thing needed
is a guiding mind to whom he would instinctively submit with reverence,
and a fine man would be the result. </p>
<p>I had no wish to leave Ghazipur this time, and certainly<!--'Volume 6 Page 243'-->
not to come to Calcutta, but Kali's illness made me go to Varanasi,
and Balaram's sudden death brought me to Calcutta. So Suresh Babu and
Balaram Babu are both gone! G. C. Ghosh is supporting the Math. . . . I
intend shortly, as soon as I can get my fare, to go up to Almora and
thence to some place in Gharwal on the Ganga where I can settle down
for a long meditation. Gangadhar is accompanying me. Indeed it was with
this desire and intention that I brought him down from Kashmir. </p>
<p>I don't think you ought to be in any hurry about coming down
to Calcutta. You have done with roving; that's good, but you have not
yet attempted the one thing you should do, that is, be resolved to sit
down and meditate. I don't think Jnana is a thing like rousing a maiden
suddenly from sleep by saying, ""Get up, dear girl, your marriage
ceremony is waiting for you!"" as we say. I am strongly of opinion that
very few persons in any Yuga (age) attain Jnana, and therefore we
should go on striving and striving even unto death. That's my
old-fashioned way, you know. About the humbug of modern Sannyasins'
Jnana I know too well. Peace be unto you and strength! Daksha, who is
staying at Vrindaban with Rakhal (Brahmananda), has learnt to make gold
and has become a <i>pucca</i> Jnani, so writes Rakhal. God
bless him, and you may say, amen! </p>
<p>I am in fine health now, and the good I gained by my stay in
Ghazipur will last, I am sure, for some time. I am longing for a flight
to the Himalayas. This time I shall not go to Pavhari Baba or any other
saint &#8212; they divert one from his highest purpose. Straight up! </p>
<p>How do you find the climate at Almora? Neither S&#8212; nor you need
come down. What is the use of so many living together in one place and
doing no good to one's soul? Don't be fools always wandering from place
to place; that's all very good, but be heroes. </p>

<p>DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra) </p>
<p>Very glad to receive your letter and that of dear Haripada.
Please do not be sorry that I could not write to you very often. I am
always praying to the Lord for your welfare. I cannot go to Belgaum now
as arrangements are all ready for my starting for America on the 31st
next. The Lord willing, I shall see you on returning from my travels in
America and Europe. Always resign yourselves to the Lord Shri Krishna.
Always remember that we are but puppets in the Lord's hands. Remain
pure always. Please be careful not to become impure even in thought, as
also in speech and action; always try to do good to others as far as in
you lies. And remember<!--'Volume 6 Page 247'--> that the
paramount duty of a woman is to serve her husband by thought, word, and
deed. Please read the Gita every day to the best of your opportunity.
Why have you signed yourself as. . . Dâsi (maidservant)? The Vaishya
and the Shudra should sign as Dâsa and Dâsi, but the Brahmin and
Kshatriya should write Deva and Devi (goddess). Moreover, these
distinctions of caste and the like have been the invention of our
modern sapient Brahmins. Who is a servant, and to whom? Everyone is a
servant of the Lord Hari. Hence a woman should use her patronymic, that
is, the surname of her husband. This is the ancient Vedic custom, as
for example, such and such Mitra, or the like. It is needless to write
much, dear mother; always know that I am constantly praying for your
well-being. From America I shall now and then write you letters with
descriptions of the wonderful things there. I am now at Bombay, and
shall stay here up to the 31st. The private Secretary to the Maharaja
of Khetri has come here to see me off. </p>

much nonsense of that type. And now after a year's experience of
American homes, of American women, how utterly false and erroneous that
sort of judgment appears! American women! A hundred lives would not be
sufficient to pay my deep debt of gratitude to you! I have not words
enough to express my gratitude to you. ""The Oriental hyperbole"" alone
expresses the depth of Oriental gratitude &#8212; ""If the Indian Ocean were

the scroll and time itself the writer"" (Adapted from the <i>Shiva-Mahimnah-Stotram.</i>)

<p>Last year I came to this country in summer, a wandering
preacher of a far distant country, without name, fame, wealth, or
learning to recommend me &#8212; friendless, helpless, almost in a state of
destitution and American women befriended me, gave me shelter and food,
took me to their homes and treated me as their own son, their own
brother. They stood my friends even when their own priests were trying
to persuade them to give up the ""dangerous heathen"" &#8212; even when day
after day their best friends had told them not to stand by this
""unknown foreigner, may be, of dangerous character"". But they are
better judges of character and soul &#8212; for it is the pure mirror that
catches the reflection. </p>
<p>And how many beautiful homes I have seen, how many mothers
whose purity of character, whose unselfish love for their children are
beyond expression, how many daughters and pure maidens, ""pure as the
icicle on Diana's temple"", and withal with much culture, education,<!--'Volume 6 Page 249'-->
and spirituality in the highest sense! Is America then full of only
wingless angels in the shape of women? There is good and bad
everywhere, true &#8212; but a nation is not to be judged by its weaklings
called the wicked, as they are only the weeds which lag behind, but by
the good, the noble, and the pure who indicate the national
life-current to be flowing clear and vigorous. </p>
<p>Do you judge of an apple tree and the taste of its fruits by
the unripe, undeveloped, worm-eaten ones that strew the ground, large

<p>And then the modern American women &#8212; I admire their broad and
liberal minds. I have seen many liberal and broad-minded men too in
this country, some even in the narrowest churches, but here is the
difference &#8212; there is danger with the men to become broad at the cost
of religion, at the cost of spirituality &#8212; women broaden out in
sympathy to everything that is good everywhere, without losing a bit of
their own religion. They intuitively know that it is a question of
positivity and not negativity, a question of addition and not
subtraction. They are every day becoming aware of the fact that it is
the affirmative and positive side of everything that shall be stored

<p class=""right"">C/O GEORGE W. HALE, ESQ., <br>
541 DEARBORN AVENUE, CHICAGO, <br>
<i>19th March, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SHASHI (RAMAKRISHNANANDA), </p>
<p>I have not written to you since coming to this country. <a name=""txt1""></a>But
Haridas Bhai's<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 250'-->
letter gives me all the news. It is excellent that <a name=""txt2""></a>G.
C. Ghosh<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 250'-->and all of you have treated him
with due consideration. </p>
<p>I have no wants in this country, but mendicancy has no vogue
here, and I have to labour, that is, lecture in places. It is as cold
here as it is hot. The summer is not a bit less hot than in Calcutta.
And how to describe the cold in winter! The whole country is covered
with snow, three or four feet deep, nay, six or seven feet at places!
In the southern parts there is no snow. Snow, however, is a thing of
little consideration here. For it snows when the mercury stands at 32°
F. In Calcutta it scarcely comes down to 60° and it rarely approaches
zero in England. But here, your mercury sinks to <i>minus</i>
4° or 5°. In Canada, in the north, mercury becomes condensed,<!--'Volume 6 Page 251'-->
when they have to use the alcohol thermometer. When it is too cold,
that is, when the mercury stands even below 20°F, it does not snow. I
used to think that it must be an exceedingly cold day on which the snow
falls. But it is not so, it snows on comparatively warm days. Extreme
cold produces a sort of intoxication. No carriages would run; only the
sledge, which is without wheels, slides on the ground! Everything is
frozen stiff &#8212; even an elephant can walk on rivers and canals and
lakes. The massive falls of Niagara, of such tremendous velocity, are
frozen to marble!! But I am doing nicely. I was a little afraid at
first, but necessity makes me travel by rail to the borders of Canada
one day, and the next day finds me lecturing in south U.S.A.! The
carriages are kept quite warm, like your own room, by means of steam
pipes, and all around are masses of snow, spotlessly white. Oh, the
beauty of it! </p>
<p>I was mortally afraid that my nose and ears would fall off,
but to this day they are all right. I have to go out, however, dressed
in a heap of warm clothing surmounted by a fur-coat, with boots encased
in a woollen jacket, and so on. No sooner do you breathe out than the
breath freezes among the beard and moustache! Notwithstanding all this,
the fun of it is that they won't drink water indoors without putting a
lump of ice into it. This is because it is warm indoors. Every room and
the staircase are kept warm by steam pipes. They are first and foremost
in art and appliances, foremost in enjoyment and luxury, foremost in
making money, and foremost in spending it. The daily wages of a coolie
are six rupees, as also are those of a servant; you cannot hire a cab
for less than three rupees, nor get a cigar for less than four annas. A
decent pair of shoes costs twenty-four rupees, and a suit, five hundred
rupees. As they earn, so they spend. A lecture fetches from two hundred
up to three thousand rupees. I have got up to <a name=""txt3""></a>five<!--'Volume 6 Page 252'-->
hundred.<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn3"">3</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 252'-->
Of course now I am in the very heyday of fortune. They like me, and
thousands of people come to hear me speak. </p>
<p>As it pleased the Lord, I met here Mr. Mazoomdar. He was very
cordial at first, but when the whole Chicago population began to flock
to me in overwhelming numbers, then grew the canker in his mind! . . .
The priests tried their utmost to snub me. But the Guru (Teacher) is
with me, what could anybody do? And the whole American nation loves and
respects me, pays my expenses, and reveres me as a Guru. ... It was not
in the power of your priests to do anything against me. Moreover, they
are a nation of scholars. Here it would no longer do to say, ""We marry
our widows"", ""We do not worship idols"", and things of that sort. What
they want is philosophy, learning; and empty talk will no more do. </p>
<p>Dharmapala is a fine boy. He has not much of learning but is
very gentle. He had a good deal of popularity in this country. </p>
<p>Brother, I have been brought to my senses. . . .<span lang=""sa"">&#2351;&#2375; &#2344;&#2367;&#2343;&#2381;&#2344;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367;

sort of
people
they are who for nothing hinder the welfare of others"" (Bhartrihari).
Brother, we can get rid of everything, but not of that cursed jealousy.
. . . That is a national sin with us, speaking ill of others, and
burning at heart at the greatness of others. Mine alone is the
greatness, none else should rise to it!! </p>
<p>Nowhere in the world are women like those of this country. How
pure, independent, self-relying, and kindhearted! It is the women who
are the life and soul of this country. All learning and culture are
centred in them. The saying, <span lang=""sa"">""&#2351;&#2366; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;:

<p>My brother, in view of all this, specially of the poverty and
ignorance, I had no sleep. At Cape Comorin sitting in Mother Kumari's
temple, sitting on the last bit of Indian rock &#8212; I hit upon a plan: We
are so many Sannyasins wandering about, and teaching the people
metaphysics &#8212; it is all madness. Did not our Gurudeva use to say, <a name=""from_east_west""></a>""An
empty stomach is no good for religion""? That those poor people are
leading the life of brutes is simply due to ignorance. We have for all
ages been sucking their blood and trampling them underfoot. </p>
<p>. . . Suppose some disinterested Sannyasins, bent on doing
good to others, go from village to village, disseminating education and
seeking in various ways to better the<!--'Volume 6 Page 255'-->
condition of all down to the Chandâla, through oral teaching, and by
means of maps, cameras, globes, and such other accessories &#8212; can't that
bring forth good in time? All these plans I cannot write out in this
short letter. The long and the short of it is &#8212; if the mountain does
not come to Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain. The poor are
too poor to come to schools and Pâthashâlâs, and they will gain nothing
by reading poetry and all that sort of thing. We, as a nation, have
lost our individuality, and that is the cause of all mischief in India.
We have to give back to the nation its lost individuality and <i>raise
the masses</i>. The Hindu, the Mohammedan, the Christian, all
have trampled them underfoot. Again the force to raise them must come
from inside, that is, from the orthodox Hindus. In every country the
evils exist not with, but against, religion. Religion therefore is not
to blame, but men. </p>
<p>To effect this, the first thing we need is men, and the next
is funds. Through the grace of our Guru I was sure to get from ten to
fifteen men in every town. I next travelled in search of funds, but do
you think the people of India were going to spend money! . . . .
Selfishness personified &#8212; are they to spend anything? Therefore I have
come to America, to earn money myself, and then return to my country
and devote the rest of my days to the realisation of this one aim of my
life. </p>
<p>As our country is poor in social virtues, so this country is
lacking in spirituality. I give them spirituality, and they give me
money. I do not know how long I shall take to realise my end. ...These
people are not hypocrites, and jealousy is altogether absent in them. I
depend on no one in Hindusthan. I shall try to earn the wherewithal
myself to the best of my might and carry out my plans, or die in the
attempt. <span lang=""sa"">""&#2360;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2367;&#2350;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#2340;&#2375; &#2357;&#2352;&#2306; &#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2327;&#2379; &#2357;&#2367;&#2344;&#2366;&#2358;&#2375;

MY DEAR SHASHI (RAMAKRISHNANANDA),

I have not written to you since coming to this country.But Haridas Bhai's1letter gives me all the news. It is excellent thatG. C. Ghosh2and all of you have treated him with due consideration.

I have no wants in this country, but mendicancy has no vogue here, and I have to labour, that is, lecture in places. It is as cold here as it is hot. The summer is not a bit less hot than in Calcutta. And how to describe the cold in winter! The whole country is covered with snow, three or four feet deep, nay, six or seven feet at places! In the southern parts there is no snow. Snow, however, is a thing of little consideration here. For it snows when the mercury stands at 32° F. In Calcutta it scarcely comes down to 60° and it rarely approaches zero in England. But here, your mercury sinks tominus4° or 5°. In Canada, in the north, mercury becomes condensed,when they have to use the alcohol thermometer. When it is too cold, that is, when the mercury stands even below 20°F, it does not snow. I used to think that it must be an exceedingly cold day on which the snow falls. But it is not so, it snows on comparatively warm days. Extreme cold produces a sort of intoxication. No carriages would run; only the sledge, which is without wheels, slides on the ground! Everything is frozen stiff — even an elephant can walk on rivers and canals and lakes. The massive falls of Niagara, of such tremendous velocity, are frozen to marble!! But I am doing nicely. I was a little afraid at first, but necessity makes me travel by rail to the borders of Canada one day, and the next day finds me lecturing in south U.S.A.! The carriages are kept quite warm, like your own room, by means of steam pipes, and all around are masses of snow, spotlessly white. Oh, the beauty of it!

I was mortally afraid that my nose and ears would fall off, but to this day they are all right. I have to go out, however, dressed in a heap of warm clothing surmounted by a fur-coat, with boots encased in a woollen jacket, and so on. No sooner do you breathe out than the breath freezes among the beard and moustache! Notwithstanding all this, the fun of it is that they won't drink water indoors without putting a lump of ice into it. This is because it is warm indoors. Every room and the staircase are kept warm by steam pipes. They are first and foremost in art and appliances, foremost in enjoyment and luxury, foremost in making money, and foremost in spending it. The daily wages of a coolie are six rupees, as also are those of a servant; you cannot hire a cab for less than three rupees, nor get a cigar for less than four annas. A decent pair of shoes costs twenty-four rupees, and a suit, five hundred rupees. As they earn, so they spend. A lecture fetches from two hundred up to three thousand rupees. I have got up tofivehundred.3Of course now I am in the very heyday of fortune. They like me, and thousands of people come to hear me speak.

As it pleased the Lord, I met here Mr. Mazoomdar. He was very cordial at first, but when the whole Chicago population began to flock to me in overwhelming numbers, then grew the canker in his mind! . . . The priests tried their utmost to snub me. But the Guru (Teacher) is with me, what could anybody do? And the whole American nation loves and respects me, pays my expenses, and reveres me as a Guru. ... It was not in the power of your priests to do anything against me. Moreover, they are a nation of scholars. Here it would no longer do to say, ""We marry our widows"", ""We do not worship idols"", and things of that sort. What they want is philosophy, learning; and empty talk will no more do.

Dharmapala is a fine boy. He has not much of learning but is very gentle. He had a good deal of popularity in this country.

Brother, I have been brought to my senses. . . .ये निध्नन्ति निरर्थकं परहितं ते के न जानीमहे— We do not know what sort of people they are who for nothing hinder the welfare of others"" (Bhartrihari). Brother, we can get rid of everything, but not of that cursed jealousy. . . . That is a national sin with us, speaking ill of others, and burning at heart at the greatness of others. Mine alone is the greatness, none else should rise to it!!

Nowhere in the world are women like those of this country. How pure, independent, self-relying, and kindhearted! It is the women who are the life and soul of this country. All learning and culture are centred in them. The saying,""या श्री: स्वयं सुकृतिनां भवनेषु— Who is the Goddessof Fortune Herself in the families of the meritorious"" (Chandi) — holds good in this country, while that other,""अलक्ष्मीः पापात्मनां— The Goddess of ill luck in the homes of the sinful"" (ibid.) — applies to ours. Just think on this. Great God! I am struck dumb with wonderment at seeing the women of America.""त्वं श्रीस्त्वमीश्वरी त्वं ह्रीः— Thou art the Goddess of Fortune, Thou art the supreme Goddess, Thou art Modesty"" (ibid.),""या देवी सर्वभूतेषु शक्तिरूपेण संस्थिता— The Goddess who resides in all beings as Power"" (ibid.) — all this holds good here. There are thousands of women here whose minds are as pure and white as the snow of this country. And look at our girls, becoming mothers below their teens!! Good Lord! I now see it all. Brother,""यत्र नार्यस्तु पूज्यन्ते रमन्ते तत्र देवताः— The gods are pleased where the women are held in esteem"" — says the old Manu. We are horrible sinners, and our degradation is due to our calling women ""despicable worms"", ""gateways to hell"", and so forth. Goodness gracious! There is all the difference between heaven and hell!!""याथातथ्यतोऽर्थान् ब्यदधात्— He adjudges gifts according to the merits of the case"" (Isha, 8). Is the Lord to be hoodwinked by idle talk? The Lord has said,""त्वं स्त्री त्वं पुमानसि त्वं कुमार उत वा कुमारी— Thou art the woman, Thou art the man, Thou art the boy and the girl as well."" (Shvetâshvatara Upa.) And we on our part are crying,""दूरमपसर रे चण्डाल— Be off, thou outcast!""""केनैषा निर्मिता नारी मोहिनीetc. — Who has made the bewitching woman?"" My brother, what experiences I have had in the South, of the upper classes torturing the lower! What Bacchanalian orgies within the temples! Is it a religion that fails to remove the misery of the poor and turn men into gods! Do you think our religion is worth the name? Ours is only Don't touchism, only ""Touch me not"", ""Touch me not."" Good heavens! A country, the big leaders of which have for the last two thousand years been only discussing whether to take food with the right hand or the left, whetherto take water from the right-hand side or from the left, ... if such a country does not go to ruin, what other will?""कालः सुप्तेषु जागर्ति कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः— Time keeps wide awake when all else sleeps. Time is invincible indeed!"" He knows it; who is there to throw dust in His eyes, my friend?

A country where millions of people live on flowers of the Mohuâ plant, and a million or two of Sadhus and a hundred million or so of Brahmins suck the blood out of these poor people, without even the least effort for their amelioration — is that a country or hell? Is that a religion, or the devil's dance? My brother, here is one thing for you to understand fully — I have travelled all over India, and seen this country too — can there be an effect without cause? Can there be punishment without sin?

सर्वशास्त्रपुराणेषु व्यासस्य वचनं ध्रुवम् ।परोपकारः पुण्याय पापाय परपीडनम् ॥

— ""Amidst all the scriptures and Purânas, know this statement of Vyâsa to be true, that doing good to others conduces to merit, and doing harm to them leads to sin.""

Isn't it true?

My brother, in view of all this, specially of the poverty and ignorance, I had no sleep. At Cape Comorin sitting in Mother Kumari's temple, sitting on the last bit of Indian rock — I hit upon a plan: We are so many Sannyasins wandering about, and teaching the people metaphysics — it is all madness.

interested in raising the women of the world and is at the head of a

wealth and position. She has been very kind to me in this country. Now
she is going to make a tour in China, Japan, Siam, and India. Of course
she will be entertained by the Governors and other high people in
India. But she is particularly anxious to see our society apart from
English official aid. I have on many occasions told her<!--'Volume 6 Page 257'-->
about your noble efforts in raising the Indian women, of your wonderful

Hopeyou are enjoying the beautiful village scenery. ""Where the world is awake, there the man of self-control is sleeping. Where the world sleeps, there he is waking."" May even the dust of the world never touch you, for, after all the poets may say, it is only a piece of carrion covered over with garlands. Touch it not — if you can. Come up, young ones of thebird1of Paradise, before your feet touch the cesspool of corruption, this world, and fly upwards.

""O those that are awake do not go to sleep again.""

""Let the world love its many, we have but one Beloved — the Lord. We care not what they say; we are only afraid when they want to paint our Beloved and give Him all sorts of monstrous qualities. Let them do whatever they please — for us He is only the beloved — my love, my love, my love, and nothing more.""

""Who cares to know how much power, how much quality He has — even that of doing good! We will say once for all: We love not for the long purse, we never sell our love, we want not, we give.""

""You, philosopher, come to tell us of His essences His powers, His attributes — fool! We are here dying for a kiss of His lips.""

""Take your nonsense back to your own home and send me a kiss of my Love — can you?""

""Fool! whom art thou bending thy tottering knees before, in awe and fear? I took my necklace and put it round His neck; and, tying a string to it as a collar, I am dragging Him along with me, for fear He may fly away even for a moment that necklace was the collar of love; that string the ecstasy of love. Fool! you know notthe secret — the Infinite One comes within my fist under the bondage of love."" ""Knowest thou not that the Lord of the Universe is the bond slave of love?"" ""Knowest thou not that the Mover of the Universe used to dance to the music of the ringing bracelets of the shepherdesses of Vrindaban?""

Excuse my mad scribbling, excuse my foolery in trying to express the inexpressible. It is to be felt only.","Ever with blessings, your brother,

ELLIOT, MAINE, <br>
<i>31st July, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTERS, </p>
<p>I have not written you long, and I have not much to write.
This is a big inn and farm-house where the Christian Scientists are
holding a session. Last spring in New York I was invited by the lady
projector of the meeting to come here, and after all I am here. It is a
beautiful and cool place, no doubt, and many of my old friends of
Chicago are here. Mrs. Mills, Miss Stockham, and several other ladies
and gentlemen live in tents which they have pitched on the open ground
by the river. They have a lively time and sometimes all of them wear
what you call your scientific dress the whole day. They have lectures
almost every day. One Mr. Colville from Boston is here; he speaks every
day, it is said, under spirit control. The Editor (?) of the <i>Universal
Truth </i>has settled herself down here. She is conducting
religious services and holding classes to heal all manner of diseases,
and very soon I expect them to be giving eyes to the blind, and the
like! After all, it is a queer gathering. They do not care much about
social laws and are quite free and happy. Mrs. Mills is quite
brilliant, and so are many other ladies. ...<!--'Volume 6 Page 260'-->
Another lady from Detroit &#8212; very cultured and with beautiful black eyes
and long hair is going to take me to an island fifteen miles out at
sea. I hope we shall have a nice time. ... I may go over to Annisquam
from here, I suppose. This is a beautiful and nice place and the
bathing is splendid. Cora Stockham has made a bathing dress for me, and
I am having as good a time in the water as a duck this is delicious
even for the denizens of mud Ville. I do not find anything more to
write. Only I am so busy that I cannot find time enough to write to
Mother Church separately. My love and respects to Miss Howe. </p>
<p>There is here Mr. Wood of Boston who is one of the great
lights of your sect. But he objects to belong to the sect of Mrs.
Whirlpool. So he calls himself a mental healer of
metaphysico-chemico-physico-religiosio what not! Yesterday there was a
tremendous cyclone which gave a good ""treatment"" to the tents. The big
tent under which they had the lectures had developed so much
spirituality, under the ""treatment"", that it entirely disappeared from
mortal gaze, and about two hundred chairs were dancing about the
grounds under spiritual ecstasy! Mrs. Figs of Mills company gives a
class every morning; and Mrs. Mills is jumping all about the place;
they are all in high spirits. I am especially glad for Cora, for they
have suffered a good deal last winter and a little hilarity would do
her good. You will be astounded with the liberty they enjoy in the
camps, but they are very good and pure people there &#8212; a little erratic
and that is all. I shall be here till Saturday next. ... </p>
<p>... The other night the camp people went to sleep beneath a
pine tree under which I sit every morning <i>a la</i>
Hindu and talk to them. Of course I went with them, and we had a nice
night under the stars, sleeping on the lap of mother earth, and I
enjoyed every bit of it. I cannot describe to you that night's glories
&#8212; after a year of brutal life that I have led, to sleep on the ground,
to meditate<!--'Volume 6 Page 261'--> under the tree in
the forest! The inn people are more or less well-to-do, and the camp
people are healthy, young, <i>sincere</i>, and holy men
and women. I teach them Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, and they all repeat it,
innocent and pure as they are and brave beyond all bounds. And so I am
happy and glorified. Thank God for making me poor, thank God for making
these children in the tents poor. The Dudes and Dudines are in the
Hotel, but iron-bound nerves and souls of triple steel and spirits of
fire are in the camp. If you had seen them yesterday, when the rain was
falling in torrents and the cyclone was overturning everything, hanging
by their tent strings to keep them from being blown down, and standing
on the majesty of their souls &#8212; these brave ones &#8212; it would have done
your hearts good. I will go a hundred miles to see the like of them.
Lord bless them! I hope you are enjoying your nice village life. Never
be anxious for a moment. I <i>will</i> be taken care of,
and if not, I <i>will</i> know my time has come and shall
pass out. </p>
<p>""Sweet One! Many people offer to You many things, I am poor &#8212;
but I have the body, mind, and soul. I give them over to You. Deign to
accept, Lord of the Universe, and refuse them not."" &#8212; So have I given
over my life and soul once for all. One thing &#8212; they are a dry sort of
people here &#8212; and as to that very few in the whole world are there that
are not. They do not understand ""Mâdhava"", the Sweet One. They are
either intellectual or go after faith cure, table turning, witchcraft,
etc., etc. Nowhere have I heard so much about ""love, life, and liberty""
as in this country, but nowhere is it less understood. Here God is
either a terror or a healing power, vibration, and so forth. Lord bless
their souls! And these parrots talk day and night of love and love and
love! </p>
<p>Now, good dreams, good thoughts for you. You are good and
noble. Instead of materialising the spirit, that<!--'Volume 6 Page 262'-->
is, dragging the spiritual to the material plane as these folks do,
convert the matter into spirit, catch a glimpse at least, every day, of
that world of infinite beauty and peace and purity &#8212; the spiritual, and
try to live in it day and night. Seek not, touch not with your toes
even, anything that is uncanny. Let your souls ascend day and night
like an ""unbroken string"" unto the feet of the Beloved whose throne is
in your own hearts and let the rest take care of themselves, that is
the body and everything else. Life is evanescent, a fleeting dream;
youth and beauty fade. Say day and night, ""Thou art my father, my
mother, my husband, my love, my lord, my God &#8212; I want nothing but Thee,
nothing but Thee, nothing but Thee. Thou in me, I in Thee, I am Thee.
Thou art me."" Wealth goes, beauty vanishes, life flies, powers fly &#8212;
but the Lord abideth for ever, love abideth for ever. If here is glory
in keeping the machine in good trim, it is more glorious to withhold
the soul from suffering with the body &#8212; that is the only demonstration
of your being ""not matter"", by letting the matter alone. </p>
<p>Stick to God! Who cares what comes to the body or to anything
else! Through the terrors of evil, say &#8212; my God, my love! Through the
pangs of death, say &#8212; my God, my love! Through all the evils under the
sun, say &#8212; my God, my love! Thou art here, I see Thee. Thou art with
me, I feel Thee. I am Thine, take me. I am not of the world's but
Thine, leave not then me. Do not go for glass beads leaving the mine of
diamonds! This life is a great chance. What, seekest thou the pleasures
of the world? &#8212; He is the fountain of all bliss. Seek for the highest,
aim at that highest, and you <i>shall</i> reach the
highest.&nbsp; </p>

) </p>
<p class=""center""><i>Salutations to Bhagavan Shri
Ramakrishna!</i></p>
<p class=""right""><i>1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR BROTHERS, (Brother-disciples of Swamiji.) </p>
<p>Before this I wrote to you a letter which for want of time was
very incomplete. Rakhal (Brahmananda) and Hari (Turiyananda) wrote in a
letter from Lucknow that Hindu newspapers were praising me, and that
they were very glad that twenty thousand people had partaken of food at
Shri Ramakrishna's anniversary. I could do much more work but for the
Brahmos and missionaries who have been opposing me unceasingly, and the
Hindus of India too did nothing for me. I mean, if the Hindus of
Calcutta or Madras had held a meeting and passed a resolution
recognising me as their representative, and thanking the American
people for receiving me with kindness, things would have progressed
appreciably. But it is over a year, and nothing done. Of course I never
relied on the Bengalis, but the Madrasis couldn't do anything either.
... </p>
<p>There is no hope for our nation. Not one original idea crosses
anyone's brains, all fighting over the same old, threadbare rug &#8212; that
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was such and such &#8212; and cock-and-bull stories &#8212;
stories having neither head nor tail. My God! Won't you do something to
show that you are in any way removed from the common run of men! &#8212; Only
indulging in madness! ... Today you have your bell, tomorrow you add a
horn, and follow suit with a chowry the day after; or you introduce a
cot today, and tomorrow you have its legs silver-mounted, and people
help themselves to a rice-porridge, and you spin out two thousand
cock-and-bull stories &#8212; in short, nothing but external ceremonials.
This is called in English imbecility. Those into whose heads nothing
but that sort of silliness enters are called imbecile.<!--'Volume 6 Page 264'-->
Those whose heads have a tendency to be troubled day and night over
such questions as whether the bell should ring on the right or on the
left, whether the sandal-paste mark should be put on the head or
anywhere else, whether the light should be waved twice or four times &#8212;
simply deserve the name of wretches, and it is owing to that sort of
notion that we are the outcasts of Fortune, kicked and spurned at,
while the people of the West are masters of the whole world. ... There
is an ocean of difference between idleness and renunciation. </p>
<p>If you want any good to come, just throw your ceremonials
overboard and worship the Living God, the Man-God &#8212; every being that
wears a human form &#8212; God in His universal as well as individual aspect.
The universal aspect of God means this world, and worshipping it means
serving it &#8212; this indeed is work, not indulging in ceremonials. Neither
is it work to cogitate as to whether the rice-plate should be placed in
front of the God for ten minutes or for half an hour &#8212; that is called
lunacy. Millions of rupees have been spent only that the templedoors at
Varanasi or Vrindaban may play at opening and shutting all day long!
Now the Lord is having His toilet, now He is taking His meals, now He
is busy on something else we know not what. ... And all this, while the
Living God is dying for want of food, for want of education! The banias
of Bombay are erecting hospitals for bugs &#8212; while they would do nothing
for men even if they die! You have not the brain to understand this
simple thing &#8212; that it is a plague with our country, and lunatic
asylums are rife all over. ... Let some of you spread like fire, and
preach this worship of the universal aspect of the Godhead &#8212; a thing
that was never undertaken before in our country. No quarrelling with
people, we must be friends with all. ... </p>
<p>Spread ideas &#8212; go from village to village, from door to door &#8212;
then only there will be real work. Otherwise,<!--'Volume 6 Page 265'-->
lying complacently on the bed and ringing the bell now and then is a
sort of disease, pure and simple. ... Be independent, learn to form
independent judgments. &#8212; That such and such a chapter of such and such
a Tantra has prescribed a standard length for the handle of a bell, &#8212;
what matters it to me? Through the Lord's will, out of your lips shall
come millions of Vedas and Tantras and Purânas. ... If now you can show
this in practice, if you can make three or four hundred thousand
disciples in India within a year, then only I may have some hope. ... </p>
<p>By the bye, you know the boy who had his head shaven and went
with Brother Tarak from Bombay to Rameswaram? He calls himself a
disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa! Let Brother Tarak initiate him.
... He had never even met Shri Ramakrishna in his life, and yet a
disciple! &#8212; What impudence! Without an unbroken chain of discipleship &#8212;
Guruparampara &#8212; nothing can be done. Is it a child's play? To have no
connection whatsoever and call oneself a disciple! The idiot! If that
boy refuses to go on in the right way, turn him out. Nothing, I say,
can be done without the chain of discipleship, that is, the power that
is transmitted from the Guru to the disciple, and from him to his
disciple, and so on. Here he comes and proclaims himself a disciple of
Ramakrishna &#8212; is it tomfoolery? Jagamohan told me of somebody calling
himself a brother-disciple of mine. I have now a suspicion that it is
that boy. To pose as a brother-disciple! He feels humiliated to call
himself a disciple, I dare say, and would fain turn a Guru straightway!
Turn him out if he does not follow the established procedure. </p>
<p>Talking of the restlessness of Tulasi (Nirmalananda) and
Subodh (Subodhananda) it all means that they have got no work to do.
... Go from village to village, do good to humanity and to the world at
large. Go to hell yourself to<!--'Volume 6 Page 266'-->
buy salvation for others. There is no Mukti on earth to call my own.
Whenever you think of yourself, you are bound to feel restless. What
business have you to do with peace, my boy? You have renounced
everything. Come! Now is the turn for you to banish the desire for
peace, and that for Mukti too! Don't worry in the least; heaven or
hell, or Bhakti or Mukti &#8212; don't care for anything, but go, my boy, and
spread the name of the Lord from door to door! It is only by doing good
to others that one attains to one's own good, and it is by leading
others to Bhakti and Mukti that one attains them oneself. Take that up,
forget&nbsp;your own self for it, be mad over the idea. As Shri
Ramakrishna
used to love you, as I love you, come, love the world like that. Bring
all together. Where is Gunanidhi? You must have him with you. My
infinite love to him. Where is Gupta (Sadananda)? Let him join if he
likes. Call him in my name. Remember these few points: </p>
<p>1. We are Sannyasins, who have given up <i>everything</i>
&#8212; Bhakti, and Mukti, and enjoyment, and all. </p>
<p>2. To do the highest good to the world, everyone down to the
lowest &#8212; this is our vow. Welcome Mukti or hell, whichever comes of it.
</p>
<p>3. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa came for the good of the world.
Call him a man, or God, or an Incarnation, just as you please. Accept
him each in your own light. </p>
<p>4. He who will bow before him will be converted into purest
gold that very moment. Go with this message from door to door, if you
can, my boy, and all your disquietude will be at an end. Never fear &#8212;
where's the room for fear? &#8212; Caring for nothing whatsoever is a part of
your life. You have so long spread his name and your character all
around, well and good. Now spread them in an organised way. The Lord is
with you. Take heart! </p>
<p>Whether I live or die, whether I go back to India<!--'Volume 6 Page 267'-->
or not, you go on spreading love, love that knows no bounds. Put Gupta
too to this task. But remember one needs weapons to overcome others.

</body></html>",10244,"Salutations to Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna!

DEAR BROTHERS, (Brother-disciples of Swamiji.)

Before this I wrote to you a letter which for want of time was very incomplete. Rakhal (Brahmananda) and Hari (Turiyananda) wrote in a letter from Lucknow that Hindu newspapers were praising me, and that they were very glad that twenty thousand people had partaken of food at Shri Ramakrishna's anniversary. I could do much more work but for the Brahmos and missionaries who have been opposing me unceasingly, and the Hindus of India too did nothing for me. I mean, if the Hindus of Calcutta or Madras had held a meeting and passed a resolution recognising me as their representative, and thanking the American people for receiving me with kindness, things would have progressed appreciably. But it is over a year, and nothing done. Of course I never relied on the Bengalis, but the Madrasis couldn't do anything either. ...

There is no hope for our nation. Not one original idea crosses anyone's brains, all fighting over the same old, threadbare rug — that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was such and such — and cock-and-bull stories — stories having neither head nor tail. My God! Won't you do something to show that you are in any way removed from the common run of men! — Only indulging in madness! ... Today you have your bell, tomorrow you add a horn, and follow suit with a chowry the day after; or you introduce a cot today, and tomorrow you have its legs silver-mounted, and people help themselves to a rice-porridge, and you spin out two thousand cock-and-bull stories — in short, nothing but external ceremonials. This is called in English imbecility. Those into whose heads nothing but that sort of silliness enters are called imbecile.Those whose heads have a tendency to be troubled day and night over such questions as whether the bell should ring on the right or on the left, whether the sandal-paste mark should be put on the head or anywhere else, whether the light should be waved twice or four times — simply deserve the name of wretches, and it is owing to that sort of notion that we are the outcasts of Fortune, kicked and spurned at, while the people of the West are masters of the whole world. ... There is an ocean of difference between idleness and renunciation.

If you want any good to come, just throw your ceremonials overboard and worship the Living God, the Man-God — every being that wears a human form — God in His universal as well as individual aspect. The universal aspect of God means this world, and worshipping it means serving it — this indeed is work, not indulging in ceremonials. Neither is it work to cogitate as to whether the rice-plate should be placed in front of the God for ten minutes or for half an hour — that is called lunacy. Millions of rupees have been spent only that the templedoors at Varanasi or Vrindaban may play at opening and shutting all day long! Now the Lord is having His toilet, now He is taking His meals, now He is busy on something else we know not what. ... And all this, while the Living God is dying for want of food, for want of education! The banias of Bombay are erecting hospitals for bugs — while they would do nothing for men even if they die! You have not the brain to understand this simple thing — that it is a plague with our country, and lunatic asylums are rife all over. ... Let some of you spread like fire, and preach this worship of the universal aspect of the Godhead — a thing that was never undertaken before in our country. No quarrelling with people, we must be friends with all. ...

Spread ideas — go from village to village, from door to door — then only there will be real work. Otherwise,lying complacently on the bed and ringing the bell now and then is a sort of disease, pure and simple. ... Be independent, learn to form independent judgments. — That such and such a chapter of such and such a Tantra has prescribed a standard length for the handle of a bell, — what matters it to me? Through the Lord's will, out of your lips shall come millions of Vedas and Tantras and Purânas. ... If now you can show this in practice, if you can make three or four hundred thousand disciples in India within a year, then only I may have some hope. ...

By the bye, you know the boy who had his head shaven and went with Brother Tarak from Bombay to Rameswaram? He calls himself a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa! Let Brother Tarak initiate him. ... He had never even met Shri Ramakrishna in his life, and yet a disciple! — What impudence! Without an unbroken chain of discipleship — Guruparampara — nothing can be done. Is it a child's play? To have no connection whatsoever and call oneself a disciple! The idiot! If that boy refuses to go on in the right way, turn him out. Nothing, I say, can be done without the chain of discipleship, that is, the power that is transmitted from the Guru to the disciple, and from him to his disciple, and so on. Here he comes and proclaims himself a disciple of Ramakrishna — is it tomfoolery? Jagamohan told me of somebody calling himself a brother-disciple of mine. I have now a suspicion that it is that boy. To pose as a brother-disciple! He feels humiliated to call himself a disciple, I dare say, and would fain turn a Guru straightway! Turn him out if he does not follow the established procedure.

Talking of the restlessness of Tulasi (Nirmalananda) and Subodh (Subodhananda) it all means that they have got no work to do. ... Go from village to village, do good to humanity and to the world at large. Go to hell yourself tobuy salvation for others. There is no Mukti on earth to call my own. Whenever you think of yourself, you are bound to feel restless. What business have you to do with peace, my boy? You have renounced everything. Come! Now is the turn for you to banish the desire for peace, and that for Mukti too! Don't worry in the least; heaven or hell, or Bhakti or Mukti — don't care for anything, but go, my boy, and spread the name of the Lord from door to door! It is only by doing good to others that one attains to one's own good, and it is by leading others to Bhakti and Mukti that one attains them oneself. Take that up, forget your own self for it, be mad over the idea. As Shri Ramakrishna used to love you, as I love you, come, love the world like that. Bring all together. Where is Gunanidhi? You must have him with you. My infinite love to him. Where is Gupta (Sadananda)? Let him join if he likes. Call him in my name. Remember these few points:

1. We are Sannyasins, who have given upeverything— Bhakti, and Mukti, and enjoyment, and all.

2. To do the highest good to the world, everyone down to the lowest — this is our vow. Welcome Mukti or hell, whichever comes of it.

3. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa came for the good of the world. Call him a man, or God, or an Incarnation, just as you please. Accept him each in your own light.

4. He who will bow before him will be converted into purest gold that very moment. Go with this message from door to door, if you can, my boy, and all your disquietude will be at an end. Never fear — where's the room for fear? — Caring for nothing whatsoever is a part of your life. You have so long spread his name and your character all around, well and good. Now spread them in an organised way. The Lord is with you. Take heart!

Whether I live or die, whether I go back to Indiaor not, you go on spreading love, love that knows no bounds. Put Gupta too to this task. But remember one needs weapons to overcome others. ""सन्निमित्ते वरं त्यागो विनाशे नियते सति — When death is so certain, it is better to die for a good cause.""","Yours affly.,

VIVEKANANDA.","PS. Remember my previous letter — we want both men and women. There is no distinction of sex in the soul.

<p>MY DEAR &#8212;,&nbsp;(Meant for his brother-disciples.) </p>
<p><br>
Glad to receive some letters from you. It gives me great pleasure to
learn that Shashi and others are making a stir. We must create a stir,
nothing short of this will do. You will be throwing the whole world
into convulsion. Victory to the Guru! You know, <span lang=""sa"">&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306;&#2360;&#2367;

about that. In every attempt there will be one set of men who will
applaud, and another who will pick holes. Go on doing your own work,
what need have you to reply to any party? <span lang=""sa"">""&#2360;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2375;&#2357;

alone triumphs, not falsehood. Through Truth lies Devayâna, the path of
gods"" (Mundaka, III. i. 6). Everything will come about by degrees.</p>
<p>Here in summer they go to the seaside: I also did the same.
They have got almost a mania for boating and yachting. The yacht is a
kind of light vessel which everyone, young and old, who has the means,
possesses. They set sail in them every day to the sea, and return home,
to eat and drink and dance &#8212; while music continues day and night.
Pianos render it a botheration to stay indoors! </p>
<p>I shall now tell you something of the Hales to whose address
you direct my letters. He and his wife are an old couple, having two
daughters, two nieces, and a son. The son lives abroad where he earns a
living. The daughters live at home. In this country, relationship is
through the girls. The son marries and no longer belongs to the family,
but the daughter's husband pays frequent visits to his father-in-law's
house. They say, </p>
<p class=""poem"">""Son is son till he gets a wife; <br>
The daughter is daughter all her life."" </p>
<p>All the four are young and not yet married. Marriage is a very
troublesome business here. In the first place, one must have a husband
after one's heart. Secondly, he must be a moneyed man. ... They will
probably live unmarried; besides, they are now full of renunciation
through my contact and are busy with thoughts of Brahman! </p>
<p>The two daughters are blondes, that is, have golden hair,
while the two nieces are brunettes, that is, of dark hair. They know
all sorts of occupations. The nieces are not so<!--'Volume 6 Page 270'-->
rich, they conduct a kindergarten school; but the daughters do not
earn. Many girls of this country earn their living. Nobody depends upon
others. Even millionaires' sons earn their living; but they marry and
have separate establishments of their own. The daughters call me
brother; and I address their mother as mother. All my things are at
their place; and they look after them, wherever I may go. Here the boys
go in search of a living while quite young; and the girls are educated
in the universities. So you will find that in a meeting there will be
ninety-nine per cent of girls. The boys are nowhere in comparison with
them. </p>
<p>There are a good many spiritualists in this country. The
medium is one who induces the spirit. He goes behind a screen; and out
of this come ghosts of all sizes and all colours. I have witnessed some
cases; but they seemed to be a hoax. I shall test some more before I
come to a final conclusion. Many of the spiritualists respect me. </p>
<p>Next comes Christian Science. They form the most influential
party, nowadays, figuring everywhere. They are spreading by leaps and
bounds, and causing heart-burn to the orthodox. They are Vedantins; I
mean, they have picked up a few doctrines of the Advaita and grafted
them upon the Bible. And they cure diseases by proclaiming ""So'ham
So'ham"" &#8212; ""I am He! I am He!"" &#8212; through strength of mind. They all
admire me highly. </p>
<p>Nowadays the orthodox section of this country are crying for
help. <a name=""txt1""></a>""Devil worship""<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a><!--'Volume 6 Page 270'-->
is but a thing of the past. They are mortally afraid of me and exclaim,
""What a pest? Thousands of men and women follow him! He is going to
root out orthodoxy!"" Well, the torch has been applied and the
conflagration that has set in through the grace of the Guru will not be
put out. In course<!--'Volume 6 Page 271'--> of time the
bigots will have their breath knocked out of them. ... </p>
<p>The Theosophists have not much power. But they, too, are dead
set against the orthodox section. </p>
<p>The Christian Science is exactly like our <a name=""txt2""></a>Kartâbhajâ<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 271'-->sect: Say, ""I have no disease"",
and you are whole; and say, ""I am He"" &#8212;
""So'ham"" &#8212; and you are quits &#8212; be at large. This is a thoroughly
materialistic country. The people of this Christian land will recognise
religion if only you can cure diseases, work miracles, and open up
avenues to money; and they understand little of anything else. But
there are honourable exceptions. ... </p>
<p>People here have found a new type of man in me. Even the
orthodox are at their wit's end. And people are now looking up to me
with an eye of reverence. Is there a greater strength than that of
Brahmacharya &#8212; purity, my boy? </p>
<p>I am now busy writing a reply to the Madras Address, which was
published in all the newspapers here and created a sensation. If it be
cheap, I shall send it in print, but if dear, I shall send a
type-written copy. To you also I shall send a copy; have it published
in the Indian Mirror. The unmarried girls of this country are very good
and have a good deal of self-respect. . . . These (the people) are come

race. To them ministering to the body is a great thing: they would trim
and polish and give their whole attention to that. A thousand
instruments for paring nails, ten thousand for hair-cutting, and who
can count the varieties of dress and toilet and perfumery? . . . They
are good-natured, kind, and truthful. All is right with them, but that
enjoyment is their<!--'Volume 6 Page 272'--> God. It is a
country where money flows like a river, with beauty as its ripple and
learning its waves, and which rolls in luxury. </p>

<p>Here you have a wonderful manifestation of grit and power &#8212;
what strength, what practicality, and what manhood! Horses huge as
elephants are drawing carriages that are as big as houses. You may take
this as a specimen of the gigantic proportions in other things also.
Here is a manifestation of tremendous energy. ... They look with
veneration upon women, who play a most prominent part in their lives.
Here this form of worship has attained its perfection &#8212; that is the
long and the short of it. But to come to the point. Well, I am almost
at my wit's end to see the women of this country! They take me to the
shops and everywhere, as if I were a child. They do all sorts of work &#8212;
I cannot do even a sixteenth part of what they do. They are like
Lakshmi (the Goddess of Fortune) in beauty, and like Sarasvati (the
Goddess of Learning) in virtues &#8212; they are the Divine Mother incarnate
and worshipping them, one verily attains perfection in everything.
Great God! Are we to be counted among men? If I can raise a thousand
such Madonnas, Incarnations of the Divine Mother, in our country before
I die, I shall die in peace. Then only will your countrymen become
worthy of their name. . . . </p>
<p>I am really struck with wonder to see the women here. How
gracious the Divine Mother is on them! Most wonderful women, these!
They are about to corner the men, who have been nearly worsted in the
competition. It is all through Thy grace, O Mother! ... I shall<!--'Volume 6 Page 273'-->
not rest till I root out this distinction of sex. Is there any
sex-distinction in the Atman (Self)? Out with the differentiation
between man and woman &#8212; all is Atman! Give up the identification with
the body, and stand up! Say, ""Asti, Asti"" &#8212; ""Everything is!"" &#8212; cherish
positive thoughts. By dwelling too much upon ""Nâsti, Nâsti"" &#8212; ""It is
not! It is not!"" (negativism), the whole country is going to ruin!
""So'ham, So'ham, Shivo'ham"" &#8212; ""I am He! I am He! I am Shiva!"" What a
botheration! In every soul is infinite strength; and should you turn
yourselves into cats and dogs by harbouring negative thoughts? Who
dares to preach negativism? Whom do you call weak and powerless?
""Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham"" &#8212; ""I am Shiva! I am Shiva!"" I feel as if a
thunderbolt strikes me on the head when I hear people dwell on negative
thoughts. That sort of self-depreciating attitude is another name for

<p>It is welcome news that Madras is in a stir. </p>
<p>Were you not going to start a paper or something of that sort,
what about that? We must mix with all, and alienate none. All the
powers of good against all the powers of evil &#8212; this is what we want.
Do not insist upon everybody's believing in our Guru. . . . You shall
have to edit a magazine, half Bengali and half Hindi &#8212; and if possible,
another in English . . . . It won't do to be roaming aimlessly.
Wherever you go, you must start a permanent preaching centre. Then only
will people begin to change. I am writing a book. As soon as it is
finished, I run for home! . . . Always remember that Shri Ramakrishna
came for the good of the world &#8212; not for name or fame. <i>Spread
only what he came to teach. Never mind his flame &#8212; it will spread of
itself.</i> Directly you insist on everybody's accepting your
Guru, you will be creating a sect, and everything will fall to the
ground &#8212; so beware! Have a kind word for all &#8212; it spoils work to show
temper. Let people say whatever they like, stick to your own
convictions, and rest assured, the world will be at your feet. They
say, ""Have faith in this fellow or that fellow"", but I say, ""Have faith
in yourself first"", that's the way. Have faith in yourself &#8212; all power
is in you &#8212; be conscious and bring it out. Say, ""I can do everything.""
""Even the poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it.""
Beware! No saying ""nay"", no negative thoughts! Say, ""Yea, Yea,""

</body></html>",25564,"MY DEAR —, (Meant for his brother-disciples.)

Glad to receive some letters from you. It gives me great pleasure to learn that Shashi and others are making a stir. We must create a stir, nothing short of this will do. You will be throwing the whole world into convulsion. Victory to the Guru! You know,श्रेयांसि बहुविघ्नानि— Great undertakings are always fraught with many obstacles."" It is these obstacles which knock and shape great characters. ... Is it in the power of missionaries and people of that sort to withstand this shock? ... Should a fool succeed where scholars have failed? It is no go, my boy, set your mind at easeabout that. In every attempt there will be one set of men who will applaud, and another who will pick holes. Go on doing your own work, what need have you to reply to any party?""सत्यमेव जयते नानृतं सत्येन पन्था विततो देवयानः— Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood. Through Truth lies Devayâna, the path of gods"" (Mundaka, III. i. 6). Everything will come about by degrees.

Here in summer they go to the seaside: I also did the same. They have got almost a mania for boating and yachting. The yacht is a kind of light vessel which everyone, young and old, who has the means, possesses. They set sail in them every day to the sea, and return home, to eat and drink and dance — while music continues day and night. Pianos render it a botheration to stay indoors!

I shall now tell you something of the Hales to whose address you direct my letters. He and his wife are an old couple, having two daughters, two nieces, and a son. The son lives abroad where he earns a living. The daughters live at home. In this country, relationship is through the girls. The son marries and no longer belongs to the family, but the daughter's husband pays frequent visits to his father-in-law's house. They say,

""Son is son till he gets a wife;The daughter is daughter all her life.""

All the four are young and not yet married. Marriage is a very troublesome business here. In the first place, one must have a husband after one's heart. Secondly, he must be a moneyed man. ... They will probably live unmarried; besides, they are now full of renunciation through my contact and are busy with thoughts of Brahman!

The two daughters are blondes, that is, have golden hair, while the two nieces are brunettes, that is, of dark hair. They know all sorts of occupations. The nieces are not sorich, they conduct a kindergarten school; but the daughters do not earn. Many girls of this country earn their living. Nobody depends upon others. Even millionaires' sons earn their living; but they marry and have separate establishments of their own. The daughters call me brother; and I address their mother as mother. All my things are at their place; and they look after them, wherever I may go. Here the boys go in search of a living while quite young; and the girls are educated in the universities. So you will find that in a meeting there will be ninety-nine per cent of girls. The boys are nowhere in comparison with them.

There are a good many spiritualists in this country. The medium is one who induces the spirit. He goes behind a screen; and out of this come ghosts of all sizes and all colours. I have witnessed some cases; but they seemed to be a hoax. I shall test some more before I come to a final conclusion. Many of the spiritualists respect me.

Next comes Christian Science. They form the most influential party, nowadays, figuring everywhere. They are spreading by leaps and bounds, and causing heart-burn to the orthodox. They are Vedantins; I mean, they have picked up a few doctrines of the Advaita and grafted them upon the Bible. And they cure diseases by proclaiming ""So'ham So'ham"" — ""I am He! I am He!"" — through strength of mind. They all admire me highly.

Nowadays the orthodox section of this country are crying for help.""Devil worship""1is but a thing of the past. They are mortally afraid of me and exclaim, ""What a pest? Thousands of men and women follow him! He is going to root out orthodoxy!"" Well, the torch has been applied and the conflagration that has set in through the grace of the Guru will not be put out. In courseof time the bigots will have their breath knocked out of them. ...

The Theosophists have not much power. But they, too, are dead set against the orthodox section.

The Christian Science is exactly like ourKartâbhajâ2sect: Say, ""I have no disease"", and you are whole; and say, ""I am He"" — ""So'ham"" — and you are quits — be at large. This is a thoroughly materialistic country. The people of this Christian land will recognise religion if only you can cure diseases, work miracles, and open up avenues to money; and they understand little of anything else. But there are honourable exceptions. ...

People here have found a new type of man in me. Even the orthodox are at their wit's end. And people are now looking up to me with an eye of reverence. Is there a greater strength than that of Brahmacharya — purity, my boy?

I am now busy writing a reply to the Madras Address, which was published in all the newspapers here and created a sensation. If it be cheap, I shall send it in print, but if dear, I shall send a type-written copy. To you also I shall send a copy; have it published in the Indian Mirror. The unmarried girls of this country are very good and have a good deal of self-respect. . . . These (the people) are come ofVirochana's3race. To them ministering to the body is a great thing: they would trim and polish and give their whole attention to that. A thousand instruments for paring nails, ten thousand for hair-cutting, and who can count the varieties of dress and toilet and perfumery? . . . They are good-natured, kind, and truthful. All is right with them, but that enjoyment is theirGod. It is a country where money flows like a river, with beauty as its ripple and learning its waves, and which rolls in luxury.

कांक्षन्तः कर्मणां सिद्धिं यजन्त इह देवताः।क्षिप्रं हि मानुषे लोके सिद्धिर्भवति कर्मजा॥

— ""Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the deities. For success is quickly attained through action in this world of Man."" (Gita, IV.12).

Here you have a wonderful manifestation of grit and power — what strength, what practicality, and what manhood! Horses huge as elephants are drawing carriages that are as big as houses. You may take this as a specimen of the gigantic proportions in other things also. Here is a manifestation of tremendous energy. ... They look with veneration upon women, who play a most prominent part in their lives. Here this form of worship has attained its perfection — that is the long and the short of it. But to come to the point. Well, I am almost at my wit's end to see the women of this country! They take me to the shops and everywhere, as if I were a child. They do all sorts of work — I cannot do even a sixteenth part of what they do. They are like Lakshmi (the Goddess of Fortune) in beauty, and like Sarasvati (the Goddess of Learning) in virtues — they are the Divine Mother incarnate and worshipping them, one verily attains perfection in everything. Great God! Are we to be counted among men? If I can raise a thousand such Madonnas, Incarnations of the Divine Mother, in our country before I die, I shall die in peace. Then only will your countrymen become worthy of their name. . . .

I am really struck with wonder to see the women here. How gracious the Divine Mother is on them! Most wonderful women, these! They are about to corner the men, who have been nearly worsted in the competition. It is all through Thy grace, O Mother! ... I shallnot rest till I root out this distinction of sex. Is there any sex-distinction in the Atman (Self)? Out with the differentiation between man and woman — all is Atman! Give up the identification with the body, and stand up! Say, ""Asti, Asti"" — ""Everything is!"" — cherish positive thoughts. By dwelling too much upon ""Nâsti, Nâsti"" — ""It is not! It is not!"" (negativism), the whole country is going to ruin! ""So'ham, So'ham, Shivo'ham"" — ""I am He! I am He! I am Shiva!"" What a botheration! In every soul is infinite strength; and should you turn yourselves into cats and dogs by harbouring negative thoughts? Who dares to preach negativism? Whom do you call weak and powerless? ""Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham"" — ""I am Shiva! I am Shiva!"" I feel as if a thunderbolt strikes me on the head when I hear people dwell on negative thoughts. That sort of self-depreciating attitude is another name for disease — do you call that humility? It is vanity in disguise!""न लिङ्गम् धर्मकारणं, समता सर्वभूतेषु एतन्मुक्तस्य लक्षणम्— The external badge does not confer spirituality. It is same-sightedness to all beings which is the test of a liberated soul.""""अस्ति अस्ति""(It is, It is),""सोऽहं सोऽहं"", ""चिदानन्दरूपः शिवोऽहं शिवोऽहं""— ""I am He!"", ""I am Shiva, of the essence of Knowledge and Bliss!""""निर्गच्छति जगज्जालात् पिञ्जरादिव केशरी— He frees himself from the meshes of this world as a lion from its cage!""""नायमात्मा बलहीनेन लभ्यः— This Atman is not accessible to the weak"". . . . Hurl yourselves on the world like an avalanche — let the world crack in twain under your weight! Hara! Hara! Mahâdeva!उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानम्— One must save the self by one's own self"" — by personal prowess.

. . . Will such a day come when this life will go for the sake of other's good? The world is not a child's play — and great men are those who build highways for others with their heart's blood. This has been taking place through eternity, that one builds a bridge by laying down his ownbody and thousands of others cross the river through its help.""एवमस्तु, एवमस्तु, शिवोऽहं शिवोऽहं — Be it so! Be it so! I am Shiva! I am Shiva!""

It is welcome news that Madras is in a stir.

Were you not going to start a paper or something of that sort, what about that? We must mix with all, and alienate none. All the powers of good against all the powers of evil — this is what we want. Do not insist upon everybody's believing in our Guru. . . . You shall have to edit a magazine, half Bengali and half Hindi — and if possible, another in English . . . . It won't do to be roaming aimlessly. Wherever you go, you must start a permanent preaching centre. Then only will people begin to change. I am writing a book. As soon as it is finished, I run for home! . . . Always remember that Shri Ramakrishna came for the good of the world — not for name or fame.Spread only what he came to teach. Never mind his flame — it will spread of itself.Directly you insist on everybody's accepting your Guru, you will be creating a sect, and everything will fall to the ground — so beware! Have a kind word for all — it spoils work to show temper. Let people say whatever they like, stick to your own convictions, and rest assured, the world will be at your feet. They say, ""Have faith in this fellow or that fellow"", but I say, ""Have faith in yourself first"", that's the way. Have faith in yourself — all power is in you — be conscious and bring it out. Say, ""I can do everything."" ""Even the poison of a snake is powerless if you can firmly deny it."" Beware! No saying ""nay"", no negative thoughts! Say, ""Yea, Yea,"" ""So'ham, So'ham"" — ""I am He! I am He!""

किन्नाम रोदिषि सखे त्वयि सर्वशक्तिरामन्त्रयस्व भगवन् भगदं स्वरूपम्।त्रैलोक्यमेतदखिलं तव पादमूले आत्मैव हि प्रभवते न जडः कदाचित्॥

— ""What makes you weep, my friend? In you is all power. Summon up your all-powerful nature, O mightyone, and this whole universe will lie at your feet. It is the Self alone that predominates, and not matter.""

To work, with undaunted energy! What fear! Who is powerful enough to thwart you!""कुर्मस्तारकचर्वणं त्रिभुवनमुत्पाटयामी बलात् , किं भो न विजानास्यस्मान् रामकृष्णदासा वयम्"" — We shall crush the stars to atoms, and unhinge the universe. Don't you know who we are? We are the servants of Shri Ramakrishna."" Fear?

Whom to fear, forsooth?

क्षीणाः स्म दीनाः सकरुणा जल्पन्ति मूढा जनानास्तिक्यन्त्विदन्तु अहह देहात्मवादातुराः।प्राप्ताः स्म वीरा गतभया अभयं प्रतिष्ठां यदाआस्तिक्यन्त्विदन्तु चिनुमः रामकृष्णदासा वयम्॥पीत्वा पीत्वा परमममृतं वीतसंसाररागाःहित्वा हित्वा सकलकलहप्रापिणीं स्वार्थसिद्धिम् ।ध्यात्वा ध्यात्वा गुरुवरपदं सर्वकल्याणरूपम्नत्वा नत्वा सकलभुवनं पातुमामन्त्रयामः॥प्राप्तं यद्वै त्वनादिनिधनं वेदोदधिं मथित्वादत्तं यस्य प्रकरणे हरिहरब्रह्मादिदेवैर्बलम्।पूर्णं यत्तु प्राणसारैर्भौमनारायणानांरामकृष्णस्तनुं धत्ते तत्पूर्णपात्रमिदं भोः॥

— ""It is those foolish people who identify themselves with their bodies, that piteously cry, 'We are weak, we are low.' All this is atheism. Now that we have attained the state beyond fear, we shall have no more fear and become heroes. This indeed is theism which we, the servants of Shri Ramakrishna, will choose.

""Giving up the attachment for the world and drinking constantly the supreme nectar of immortality, for ever discarding that self-seeking spirit which is the mother ofall dissension, and ever meditating on the blessed feet of our Guru which are the embodiment of all well-being, with repeated salutations we invite the whole world to participate in drinking the nectar.

""That nectar which has been obtained by churning the infinite ocean of the Vedas, into which Brahmâ, Vishnu, Shiva, and the other gods have poured their strength, which is charged with the life-essence of the Avataras — Gods Incarnate on earth — Shri Ramakrishna holds that nectar in his person, in its fullest measure!""

We must work among the English educated young men.""त्यागेनैके अमृतत्वमानशुः— Through renunciation alone some (rare ones) attained immortality."" Renunciation! — Renunciation! — you must preach this above everything else. There will be no spiritual strength unless one renounces the world....

Why are Baburam and Yogen suffering so much? It is owing to their negative, their self-abasing spirit. Tell them to brush aside their illness by mental strength, and in an hour it will disappear! I the Atman smitten with disease! Off with it! Tell them to meditate for an hour at a stretch, ""I am the Atman, how can I be affected by disease!"" — and everything will vanish. Think all of you that you are the infinitely powerful Atman, and see what strength comes out. . . . Self-depreciation! What is it for? I am the child of the Infinite, the all-powerful Divine Mother. What means disease, or fear, or want to me? Stamp out the negative spirit as if it were a pestilence, and it will conduce to your welfare in every way. No negative, all positive, affirmative. Iam, God is, everything is in me. Iwillmanifest health, purity, knowledge, whatever I want. Well, these foreign people could grasp my teachings, and you are suffering from illness owing to your negative spirit! Who says you are ill — what is disease to you? Brush it aside!वीर्यमसि वीर्यं मयि धेहि, बलमसि बलं मयि धेहि, ओजोऽसि ओजो मयि धेहि, सहोऽसि सही मयि धेहि— Thou art Energy, impart energy unto me. Thou art Strength, impart strength unto me. Thou art Spirituality, impart spirituality unto me. Thou art Fortitude, impart fortitude unto me!"" The ceremony of steadying the seat (Âsana-pratishthâ) that you perform every day when you sit down to worship the Lord —""आत्मानमच्छिद्रं भावयेत्— One must think of oneself as strong and invulnerable,"" and so forth — what does it all mean? Say, ""Everything is in me, and I can manifest it at will."" Repeat to yourself that such and such are Atman, that they are infinite, and how can they have any disease? Repeat this an hour or so, on a few successive days, and all disease and trouble will vanish into nought.","Yours ever,

<i>30th November, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR AND BELOVED, (Dr. Nanjunda Rao.) </p>
<p>Your beautiful letter just came to hand. I am so glad that you
have come to know Shri Ramakrishna. I am very glad at the strength of
your Vairâgya. It is the one primary<!--'Volume 6 Page 280'-->
necessity in reaching God. I had always great hopes for Madras, and
still I have the firm belief that from Madras will come the spiritual
wave that will deluge India. I can only say Godspeed to your good
intentions; but here, my son, are the difficulties. In the first place,
no man ought to take a hasty step. In the second place, you must have
some respect for the feelings of your mother and wife. True, you may
say that we, the disciples of Ramakrishna, had not always shown great
deference to the opinions of our parents. I know, and know for sure,
that great things are done only by great sacrifices. I know for certain
that India requires the sacrifice of her highest and best, and I
sincerely hope that it will be your good fortune to be one of them. </p>
<p>Throughout the history of the world you find great men make
great sacrifices and the mass of mankind enjoy the benefit. If you want
to give up everything for your own salvation, it is nothing. Do you
want to forgo even your own salvation for the good of the world? You
are God, think of that. My advice to you is to live the life of a
Brahmacharin, i.e. giving up all sexual enjoyments for a certain time
live in the house of your father; this is the ""Kutichaka"" stage. Try to
bring your wife to consent to your great sacrifice for the good of the
world. And if you have burning faith and all-conquering love and
almighty purity, I do not doubt that you will shortly succeed. Give
yourself body and soul to the work of spreading the teachings of Shri
Ramakrishna, for work (Karma) is the first stage. Study Sanskrit
diligently as well as practice devotion. For you are to be a great
teacher of mankind, and my Guru Maharaja used to say, ""A penknife is
sufficient to commit suicide with, but to kill others one requires guns
and swords."" And in the fullness of time it will be given unto you when
to go forth out of the world and preach His sacred name. Your

Your beautiful letter just came to hand. I am so glad that you have come to know Shri Ramakrishna. I am very glad at the strength of your Vairâgya. It is the one primarynecessity in reaching God. I had always great hopes for Madras, and still I have the firm belief that from Madras will come the spiritual wave that will deluge India. I can only say Godspeed to your good intentions; but here, my son, are the difficulties. In the first place, no man ought to take a hasty step. In the second place, you must have some respect for the feelings of your mother and wife. True, you may say that we, the disciples of Ramakrishna, had not always shown great deference to the opinions of our parents. I know, and know for sure, that great things are done only by great sacrifices. I know for certain that India requires the sacrifice of her highest and best, and I sincerely hope that it will be your good fortune to be one of them.

Throughout the history of the world you find great men make great sacrifices and the mass of mankind enjoy the benefit. If you want to give up everything for your own salvation, it is nothing. Do you want to forgo even your own salvation for the good of the world? You are God, think of that. My advice to you is to live the life of a Brahmacharin, i.e. giving up all sexual enjoyments for a certain time live in the house of your father; this is the ""Kutichaka"" stage. Try to bring your wife to consent to your great sacrifice for the good of the world. And if you have burning faith and all-conquering love and almighty purity, I do not doubt that you will shortly succeed. Give yourself body and soul to the work of spreading the teachings of Shri Ramakrishna, for work (Karma) is the first stage. Study Sanskrit diligently as well as practice devotion. For you are to be a great teacher of mankind, and my Guru Maharaja used to say, ""A penknife is sufficient to commit suicide with, but to kill others one requires guns and swords."" And in the fullness of time it will be given unto you when to go forth out of the world and preach His sacred name. Your determination is holy and good. Godspeed to you, but do not take anyhasty step. First purify yourself by work and devotion India has suffered long, the Religion Eternal has suffered long. But the Lord is merciful. Once more He has come to help His children, once more the opportunity is given to rise to fallen India. India can only rise by sitting at the feet of Shri Ramakrishna. His life and his teachings are to be spread far and wide, are to be made to penetrate every pore of Hindu society. Who will do it? Who are to take up the flag of Ramakrishna and march for the salvation of the world? Who are to stem the tide of degeneration at the sacrifice of name and fame, wealth and enjoyment — nay of every hope of this or other worlds? A few young men have jumped in the breach, have sacrificed themselves. They are a few; we want a few thousands of such as they, andthey will come. I am glad that our Lord has put it in your mind to be one of them Glory unto him on whom falls the Lord's choice. Your determination is good, your hopes are high, your aim is the noblest in the world — to bring millions sunk in darkness to the light of the Lord.

But, my son, here are the drawbacks. Nothing shall be done in haste. Purity, patience, and perseverance are the three essentials to success and, above all,love. All time is yours, there is no indecent haste. Everything will come right if you are pure and sincere. We want hundreds like you bursting upon society and bringing new life and vigour of the Spirit wherever they go. Godspeed to you.","Yours with all blessings,

grieve over the fight of cats and dogs? So the jealousy, envy, and
elbowing of common men should make no impression on your mind. For the

out one's mind. These are things not for writing. . . . Never let go
your hold of the rudder, grasp it firm. We are steering all right, no
mistaking that, but landing on the other shore is only a question of
time. That's all. Can a leader be made my brother? A leader is born. Do
you understand? And it is a very difficult task to take on the role of
a leader. &#8212; One must be <span lang=""sa"">&#2342;&#2366;&#2360;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2342;&#2366;&#2360;&#2307;</span>
&#8212;
a servant of servants, and must accommodate a thousand minds. There
must not be a shade of jealousy or selfishness, then you are a leader.
First, by birth, and secondly, unselfish &#8212; that's a leader. Everything
is going all right, everything will come round. He casts the net all
right, and winds it up likewise <span lang=""sa"">&#2357;&#2351;&#2350;&#2344;&#2369;&#2360;&#2352;&#2366;&#2350;&#2307;

ours is but to follow; love is the best instrument. Love conquers in
the long run. It won't do to become impatient &#8212; wait, wait &#8212; patience
is bound to give success. . . . </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 285'-->
<p>I tell you brother, let everything go on as it is, only take
care that no form becomes necessary &#8212; unity in variety &#8212; see that
universality be not hampered in the least. Everything must be
sacrificed, if necessary, for that one sentiment, <i>universality</i>.
Whether I live or die, whether I go back to India or not, remember this
specially, that universality &#8212; perfect acceptance, not tolerance only &#8212;
we preach and perform. Take care how you trample on the least rights of
others. Many a huge ship has foundered in that whirlpool. Remember,
perfect devotion minus its bigotry &#8212; this is what we have got to show.
Through His grace everything will go all right. . . . Everybody wants
to be a leader, but it is the failure to grasp that he is <i>born</i>,
that causes all this mischief. ... </p>
<p>Our matrons are all hale and hearty, I hope? Where is Gour-Mâ?
We want a thousand such Mothers with that noble stirring spirit. ... We
want all. It is not at all necessary that all should have the same
faith in our Lord as we have, but we want to unite all the powers of
goodness against all the powers of evil. ... A besetting sin with
Sannyasins is the taking pride in their monastic order. That may have
its utility during the first stages, but when they are full-grown, they
need it no more. One must make no distinction between householders and
Sannyasins &#8212; then only one is a true Sannyasin. . . . </p>
<p>A movement which half a dozen penniless boys set on foot and
which now bids fair to progress in such an accelerated motion &#8212; is it a
humbug or the Lord's will? If it is, then let all give up party-spirit
and jealousy, and unite in action. A universal religion cannot be set
up through party faction. . . . </p>
<p>If all understand one day for one minute that one cannot
become great by the mere wish, that he only rises whom He raises, and
he falls whom He brings down then all trouble is at an end. But there
is that egotism &#8212;<!--'Volume 6 Page 286'--> hollow in
itself, and without the power to move a finger: how ludicrous of it to
say, ""I won't let anyone rise!"" That jealousy, that absence of conjoint
action is the very nature of enslaved nations. But we must try to shake
it off. The terrible jealousy is characteristic of us. . . . You will
be convinced of this if you visit some other countries. Our fellows in
this respect are the enfranchised negroes of this country &#8212; if but one
amongst them rises to greatness, all the others would at once set
themselves against him and try to level him down by making a common
cause with the whites. . . . </p>
<p>At any cost, any price, any sacrifice, we must never allow

<li><a name=""fn1""></a><a href=""#txt1"">^</a>From
internal evidence it seems that letter No. LIV vas written in the
beginning of 1894, for it refers to ""Mazoomdar's doings"", and cold

The next letter must have been written in March or April 1894, as we
infer from the Bengali biography of Swami Akhandananda.<br>

Letter number LVI belongs to the summer of 1894, for it was written
after Shri Ramakrishna's festival.<br>

Letter number LXXV belongs most probably to the beginning of 1895, for
it gives directions about Shri Ramakrishna's birthday celebration that
year; it also speaks of the retreat of winter and refers to certain

The order of these letters, however, is not altered in the absence of

Very glad to receive your letter. I am very sorry to hear of Mazoomdar's doings. One always behaves thus in trying to push oneself before all others. I am not much to blame. M— came here ten years ago, and got much reputation and honour; now I am in flying colours. Such is the will of the Guru, what shall I do? It is childishness on M—'s part to be annoyed at this. Never mind,उपेक्षितव्यं तद्वचनं भवत्सट्टशानां महात्मनाम्। अपि कीटदंशनभीरुका वयं रामकृष्ण तनयास्तदूहृदयरुधिरपोषिताः। ""अलोकसामान्यमचिन्त्यहेतुकंनिन्दन्ति मन्दाश्चरितं महात्मनाम्— Great men like you should pay no heed to what he says. Shall we, children of Shri Ramakrishna, nourished with his heart's blood, be afraid of worm-bites? ""The wicked criticise the conduct of the magnanimous, which is extraordinary and whose motives are difficult to fathom"" (Kalidasa'sKumârasambhavam.) — remember all this and forgive this fool. It is the will of the Lord that people of this land have their power of introspection roused, and does it lie in anybody to check His progress? I want no name — I want to be a voice without a form. I do not require anybody to defend me —कोऽहं तत्पादप्रसरं प्रतिरोद्धुं समर्थयितुं वा, के वान्ये? तथापि मम हृदयकृतज्ञता तान् प्रति— who am I to check or to help the course of His march? And who are others also? Still, my heartfelt gratitude to them.""यस्मिंस्थितौ न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते"" — नैषः प्राप्तवान् तत्पदवीमिति मत्वा करुणादृष्ट्या द्रष्टव्योऽयमिति— ""Established in which state a man is not moved even by great misfortune"" (Gita) — that state he has not reached; think of this and look upon him with pity. Through the Lord's will, the desire for name and fame has not yet crept into my heart, and I dare say never will. I am an instrument, and He is the operator. Through this instrument He is rousing the religious instinct in thousands of hearts in this far-off country. Thousands of men and women here love and revere me. . . .""मूकं करोति वाचालं पङ्गुं लङ्घते गिरिम्— He makes the dumb eloquent and makes the lame cross mountains."" I am amazed at His grace. Whichever town I visit, it is in an uproar. They have named me ""the cyclonic Hindu"". Remember, it is His will — I am a voice without a form.

The Lord knows whether I shall go to England or any other blessed place. He will arrange everything. Here a cigar costs one rupee. Once you get into a cab,you have to pay three rupees, a coat costs a hundred rupees; the hotel charge is nine rupees a day. The Lord provides everything. . . . The Lord be praised, I know nothing.""सत्यमेव जयते नानृतम्, सत्येन पन्था विततो देवयानः— Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood. Through Truth alone lies the path of Devayâna."" You must be fearless. It is the coward who fears and defends himself. Let no one amongst us come forward to defend me. I get all news of Madras and Rajputana from time to time. . . . There are eyes that can see at a distance of fourteen thousand miles. It is quite true. Keep quiet now, everything will see the light in time, as far as He wills it. Not one word of His proves untrue. My brother, do men grieve over the fight of cats and dogs? So the jealousy, envy, and elbowing of common men should make no impression on your mind. For the last six months I have been saying, the curtain is going up, the sun is rising. Yes, the curtain is lifting by degrees, slow but sure; you will come to know it in time.Heknows. One cannot speak out one's mind. These are things not for writing. . . . Never let go your hold of the rudder, grasp it firm. We are steering all right, no mistaking that, but landing on the other shore is only a question of time. That's all. Can a leader be made my brother? A leader is born. Do you understand? And it is a very difficult task to take on the role of a leader. — One must beदासस्य दासः— a servant of servants, and must accommodate a thousand minds. There must not be a shade of jealousy or selfishness, then you are a leader. First, by birth, and secondly, unselfish — that's a leader. Everything is going all right, everything will come round. He casts the net all right, and winds it up likewiseवयमनुसरामः वयमनुसरामः, प्रीतिः परमसाधनम्— ours is but to follow; love is the best instrument. Love conquers in the long run. It won't do to become impatient — wait, wait — patience is bound to give success. . . .

I tell you brother, let everything go on as it is, only take care that no form becomes necessary — unity in variety — see that universality be not hampered in the least. Everything must be sacrificed, if necessary, for that one sentiment,universality. Whether I live or die, whether I go back to India or not, remember this specially, that universality — perfect acceptance, not tolerance only — we preach and perform. Take care how you trample on the least rights of others. Many a huge ship has foundered in that whirlpool. Remember, perfect devotion minus its bigotry — this is what we have got to show. Through His grace everything will go all right. . . . Everybody wants to be a leader, but it is the failure to grasp that he isborn, that causes all this mischief. ...

Our matrons are all hale and hearty, I hope? Where is Gour-Mâ? We want a thousand such Mothers with that noble stirring spirit. ... We want all. It is not at all necessary that all should have the same faith in our Lord as we have, but we want to unite all the powers of goodness against all the powers of evil. ... A besetting sin with Sannyasins is the taking pride in their monastic order. That may have its utility during the first stages, but when they are full-grown, they need it no more. One must make no distinction between householders and Sannyasins — then only one is a true Sannyasin. . . .

A movement which half a dozen penniless boys set on foot and which now bids fair to progress in such an accelerated motion — is it a humbug or the Lord's will? If it is, then let all give up party-spirit and jealousy, and unite in action. A universal religion cannot be set up through party faction. . . .

If all understand one day for one minute that one cannot become great by the mere wish, that he only rises whom He raises, and he falls whom He brings down then all trouble is at an end. But there is that egotism —hollow in itself, and without the power to move a finger: how ludicrous of it to say, ""I won't let anyone rise!"" That jealousy, that absence of conjoint action is the very nature of enslaved nations. But we must try to shake it off. The terrible jealousy is characteristic of us. . . . You will be convinced of this if you visit some other countries. Our fellows in this respect are the enfranchised negroes of this country — if but one amongst them rises to greatness, all the others would at once set themselves against him and try to level him down by making a common cause with the whites. . . .

At any cost, any price, any sacrifice, we must never allow that to creep in among ourselves. Whether we be ten or two, do not care, but those few must be perfect characters. . . . ""It is not good to ask of one's father if the Lord keeps His promise (to look after His devotees)."" And the Lordwilldo so, get your minds easy on that score. . . . We must spread his name in Rajputana, Punjab, U.P., Madras, and such other provinces — yes, in Raiputana, where still there are people who can say, ""Such has ever been the custom with Raghu's line that they keep their word even at the cost of life.""

A bird, in the course of its flight, reaches a spot whence it looks on the ground below with supreme calmness, Have you reached that spot? He who has not reached there has no right to teach others. Relax your limbs and float with the current, and you are sure to reach your destination.

<p>DEAR AND BELOVED, (The brother-disciples at Alambazar
monastery.) </p>
<p>Your letter gives me all the news over there. I am grieved to
hear of the bereavement Balaram Babu's wife has sustained. Such is the
Lord's will. This is a place for action, not enjoyment, and everyone
will go home when his task is done &#8212; some earlier, and some later, that
is all. Fakir has gone &#8212; well, such is the will of the Lord! </p>
<p>It is a welcome news that Shri Ramakrishna's festival has come
off with great éclat; the more his name is spread, the better it is.
But there is one thing to know: Great sages come with special messages
for the world, and not for name; but their followers throw their
teachings overboard and fight over their names &#8212; this is verily the
history of the world. I do not take into any consideration whether
people accept his name or not, but I am ready to lay down my life to
help his teachings, his life, and his message spread all over the
world. What I am most afraid of is the worship-room. It is not bad in
itself, but there is a tendency in some to make this all in all and set
up that old-fashioned nonsense over again &#8212; this is what makes me
nervous. I know why they busy themselves with those old, effete
ceremonials. Their spirit craves for work, but having no outlet they
waste their energy in ringing bells and all that. </p>
<p>I am giving you a new idea. If you can work it out, then I
shall know you are men and will be of service. . . . Make an organised
plan. A few cameras, some maps, globes, and some chemicals, etc., are
needed. The next thing you want is a big hut. Then you must get
together a number of poor, indigent folk. Having done all this, show
them pictures to teach them astronomy, geography, etc., and<!--'Volume 6 Page 290'-->
preach Shri Ramakrishna to them. Try to have their eyes opened as to
what has taken place or is taking place in different countries, what
this world is like and, so forth. You have got lots of poor and
ignorant folk there. Go to their cottages, from door to door, in the
evening, at noon, any time and open their eyes. Books etc., won't do &#8212;
give them oral teaching. Then slowly extend your centres. Can you do
all this? Or only bell-ringing? </p>
<p>I have heard everything about Brother Tarak from Madras. They
are highly pleased with him. Dear Brother Tarak, if you go to Madras
and live there for some time, a lot of work will be done. But before
you go, start this work there first. Can't the lady devotees convert
some widows; into disciples? And can't you put a bit of learning into
their heads? And can't you then send them out to preach Sri Ramakrishna
from door to door, and impart education along with it? . . . </p>
<p>Come! Apply yourselves heart and soul to it. The day of gossip
and ceremonials is gone, my boy, <i>you must work now</i>.
Now, let me see how far a Bengali's religion will go. Niranjan writes
that Latu (Adbhutananda) wants some warm clothing. The people here
import winter clothing from Europe and India. You will get a woollen
wrap in Calcutta at one-fourth of the price at which I might buy it
here. . . . I don't know when I shall go to Europe, everything is
uncertain with me &#8212; I am getting on somehow in this country, that is
all. </p>
<p>This is a very funny country. It is now summer; this morning
it was as hot as April in Bengal, but now it is as cold as February at
Allahabad! So much fluctuation within four hours! The hotels of this
country beggar description. For instance there is a hotel in New York
where a room can be hired for up to Rs. 5,000 a day, excluding boarding
charges. Not even in Europe is there a country like this in point of
luxury. It is indeed the richest country in the world, where money is
drained off like water. I seldom<!--'Volume 6 Page 291'-->
live in hotels, but am mostly the guest of big people here. To them I
am a widely known man. The whole country knows me now; so wherever I go
they receive me with open arms into their homes. Mr. Hale's home is my
centre in Chicago. I call his wife mother, and his daughters call me
brother. I scarcely find a family so highly pure and kind. Or why
should God shower His blessings on them in such abundance, my brother?
Oh, how wonderfully kind they are! If they chance to learn that a poor
man is in a strait at such and such a place, there they will go ladies
and gentlemen, to give him food and clothing and find him some job! And
what do we do! </p>
<p>In summer they leave their homes to go to foreign lands, or to
the seaside. I, too, shall go somewhere, but have not yet fixed a
place. In other points, they are just as you see Englishmen. They have
got books and things of that sort, but very dear. You can have five
times those things In Calcutta for the same price. In other words,
these people will not let foreign goods be imported into the country.
They set a heavy tax on them, and as a result, the market goes up
enormously. Besides, they are not much in the way of manufacturing
clothing etc. They construct tools and machinery, and grow wheat, rice,
cotton, etc., which are fairly cheap. </p>
<p>By the bye, nowadays we have plenty of Hilsâ fish here. Eat
your fill, but everything digests. There are many kinds of fruits;
plantain, lemon, guava, apple, almond, raisin, and grape are in
abundance; besides many other fruits come from California. There are
plenty of pineapples but there are no mangoes or lichis, or things of
that sort. </p>
<p>There is a kind of spinach, which, when cooked, tastes just
like our Noté of Bengal, and another class, which they call asparagus,
tastes exactly like the tender Dengo herb, but you can't have our
Charchari made of it here.<!--'Volume 6 Page 292'--> There
is no Kalâi or any other pulse; they do not even know of them. There is
rice, and bread, and numerous varieties of fish and meat, of all
descriptions. Their menu is like that of the French. There is your
milk, rarely curd, but plenty of whey. Cream is an article of everyday
use. In tea and coffee and everything there is that cream &#8212; not the

too, and ice-water &#8212; no matter whether it is summer or winter, day or
night, whether you have got a bad cold or fever &#8212; you have ice-water in
abundance. These are scientific people and laugh when they are told
that ice-water aggravates cold. The more you take, the better. And
there is plenty of ice-cream, of all sorts of shapes. I have seen the
Niagara Falls seven or eight times, the Lord be praised! Very grand no
doubt, but not quite as you have heard them spoken of. One day, in
winter, we had the aurora borealis. </p>
<p>. . . Only childish prattle! I have not much time to listen to
that sort of thing in this life; it will be time enough to see if I can
do that in the next. Yogen has completely rallied by this time, I hope?
The vagabond spirit of Sarada (Trigunâtita) is not yet at an end, I
see. What is wanted is a power of organisation &#8212; do you understand me?
Have any of you got that much brain in your head? If you do, let your
mind work. Brother Tarak, Sharat, and Hari will be able to do
it.&nbsp; &#8212; has got very little originality, but is a very good
workman and persevering &#8212; which is an essential necessity, and Shashi
(Ramakrishnananda) is executive to a degree. ... We want some disciples

to the jaws of Death, and are ready to swim the ocean across. Do you
follow me? We want hundreds like that, both men and women. Try your
utmost for that end alone. Make converts right and left, and put them
into our purity-drilling machine. </p>

<p>. . . What made you communicate to the <i>Indian Mirror</i>
that Paramahamsa Deva used to call Narendra such and such, and all
sorts of nonsense? &#8212; As if he had nothing else to do but that! Only
thought-reading and nonsensical mystery-mongering! . . . It is
excellent that Sanyal is visiting you often. Do you write letters to
Gupta? Convey to him my love, and take kind care of him. Everything
will come right by degrees. I don't find much time to write heaps of
letters. As for lectures and so forth, I don't prepare them beforehand.
Only one I wrote out, which you have printed. The rest I deliver
off-hand, whatever comes to my lips &#8212; Gurudeva backs me up. I have
nothing to do with pen and paper. Once at Detroit I held forth for
three hours at a stretch. Sometimes I myself wonder at my own
achievement &#8212; to think that there was such stuff in this pate! They ask
me here to write a book. Well, I think I must do something that way,
this time. But that's the botheration; who will take the trouble of
putting things in black and white and all that! . . . We must electrify
society, electrify the world. Idle gossip and barren ceremonials won't
do. Ceremonials are meant for householders, your work is the
distribution and propagation of thought-currents. If you can do that,
then it is all right. . . . </p>
<p>Let character be formed and then I shall be in your midst. Do
you see? We want two thousand Sannyasins, nay ten, or even twenty
thousand &#8212; men and women, both. What are our matrons doing? We want
converts at any risk. Go and tell them, and try yourselves, heart and
soul. Not householder disciples, mind you, we want Sannyasins. Let each
one of you have a hundred heads tonsured &#8212; young educated men, not
fools. Then you are heroes. We must make a sensation. Give up your
passive attitude, gird your loins and stand up. Let me see you make
some electric circuits between Calcutta and Madras. Start centres at
places, go on always making<!--'Volume 6 Page 294'-->

it, irrespective of sex, and then I shall be in your midst. A huge

internal evidence it seems that letter No. LIV vas written in the

DEAR AND BELOVED, (The brother-disciples at Alambazar monastery.)

Your letter gives me all the news over there. I am grieved to hear of the bereavement Balaram Babu's wife has sustained. Such is the Lord's will. This is a place for action, not enjoyment, and everyone will go home when his task is done — some earlier, and some later, that is all. Fakir has gone — well, such is the will of the Lord!

It is a welcome news that Shri Ramakrishna's festival has come off with great éclat; the more his name is spread, the better it is. But there is one thing to know: Great sages come with special messages for the world, and not for name; but their followers throw their teachings overboard and fight over their names — this is verily the history of the world. I do not take into any consideration whether people accept his name or not, but I am ready to lay down my life to help his teachings, his life, and his message spread all over the world. What I am most afraid of is the worship-room. It is not bad in itself, but there is a tendency in some to make this all in all and set up that old-fashioned nonsense over again — this is what makes me nervous. I know why they busy themselves with those old, effete ceremonials. Their spirit craves for work, but having no outlet they waste their energy in ringing bells and all that.

I am giving you a new idea. If you can work it out, then I shall know you are men and will be of service. . . . Make an organised plan. A few cameras, some maps, globes, and some chemicals, etc., are needed. The next thing you want is a big hut. Then you must get together a number of poor, indigent folk. Having done all this, show them pictures to teach them astronomy, geography, etc., andpreach Shri Ramakrishna to them. Try to have their eyes opened as to what has taken place or is taking place in different countries, what this world is like and, so forth. You have got lots of poor and ignorant folk there. Go to their cottages, from door to door, in the evening, at noon, any time and open their eyes. Books etc., won't do — give them oral teaching. Then slowly extend your centres. Can you do all this? Or only bell-ringing?

I have heard everything about Brother Tarak from Madras. They are highly pleased with him. Dear Brother Tarak, if you go to Madras and live there for some time, a lot of work will be done. But before you go, start this work there first. Can't the lady devotees convert some widows; into disciples? And can't you put a bit of learning into their heads? And can't you then send them out to preach Sri Ramakrishna from door to door, and impart education along with it? . . .

Come! Apply yourselves heart and soul to it. The day of gossip and ceremonials is gone, my boy,you must work now. Now, let me see how far a Bengali's religion will go. Niranjan writes that Latu (Adbhutananda) wants some warm clothing. The people here import winter clothing from Europe and India. You will get a woollen wrap in Calcutta at one-fourth of the price at which I might buy it here. . . . I don't know when I shall go to Europe, everything is uncertain with me — I am getting on somehow in this country, that is all.

This is a very funny country. It is now summer; this morning it was as hot as April in Bengal, but now it is as cold as February at Allahabad! So much fluctuation within four hours! The hotels of this country beggar description. For instance there is a hotel in New York where a room can be hired for up to Rs. 5,000 a day, excluding boarding charges. Not even in Europe is there a country like this in point of luxury. It is indeed the richest country in the world, where money is drained off like water. I seldomlive in hotels, but am mostly the guest of big people here. To them I am a widely known man. The whole country knows me now; so wherever I go they receive me with open arms into their homes. Mr. Hale's home is my centre in Chicago. I call his wife mother, and his daughters call me brother. I scarcely find a family so highly pure and kind. Or why should God shower His blessings on them in such abundance, my brother? Oh, how wonderfully kind they are! If they chance to learn that a poor man is in a strait at such and such a place, there they will go ladies and gentlemen, to give him food and clothing and find him some job! And what do we do!

In summer they leave their homes to go to foreign lands, or to the seaside. I, too, shall go somewhere, but have not yet fixed a place. In other points, they are just as you see Englishmen. They have got books and things of that sort, but very dear. You can have five times those things In Calcutta for the same price. In other words, these people will not let foreign goods be imported into the country. They set a heavy tax on them, and as a result, the market goes up enormously. Besides, they are not much in the way of manufacturing clothing etc. They construct tools and machinery, and grow wheat, rice, cotton, etc., which are fairly cheap.

By the bye, nowadays we have plenty of Hilsâ fish here. Eat your fill, but everything digests. There are many kinds of fruits; plantain, lemon, guava, apple, almond, raisin, and grape are in abundance; besides many other fruits come from California. There are plenty of pineapples but there are no mangoes or lichis, or things of that sort.

There is a kind of spinach, which, when cooked, tastes just like our Noté of Bengal, and another class, which they call asparagus, tastes exactly like the tender Dengo herb, but you can't have our Charchari made of it here.There is no Kalâi or any other pulse; they do not even know of them. There is rice, and bread, and numerous varieties of fish and meat, of all descriptions. Their menu is like that of the French. There is your milk, rarely curd, but plenty of whey. Cream is an article of everyday use. In tea and coffee and everything there is that cream — not the hardened crust of boiled milk, mind you — and there is your butter, too, and ice-water — no matter whether it is summer or winter, day or night, whether you have got a bad cold or fever — you have ice-water in abundance. These are scientific people and laugh when they are told that ice-water aggravates cold. The more you take, the better. And there is plenty of ice-cream, of all sorts of shapes. I have seen the Niagara Falls seven or eight times, the Lord be praised! Very grand no doubt, but not quite as you have heard them spoken of. One day, in winter, we had the aurora borealis.

. . . Only childish prattle! I have not much time to listen to that sort of thing in this life; it will be time enough to see if I can do that in the next.

We want hundreds like that, both men and women. Try your utmost for that end alone. Make converts right and left, and put them into our purity-drilling machine.

<p>DEAR SARADA, </p>
<p>Your two letters are to hand, as also the two of Ramdayal
Babu. I have got the bill of lading; but it will be long before the
goods arrive. Unless one arranges for the prompt despatch of goods they
take about six months to come. It is four months since Haramohan wrote
that the Rudrâksha beads and Kusha mats had been despatched, but there
is no news of their whereabouts yet. The thing is, when the goods reach
England, the agent of the company here gives me notice; and about a
month later, the goods arrive. I received your bill of lading about
three weeks ago, but no sign of the notice! Only the goods sent by Raja
of Khetri arrive quickly. Most probably he spends a lot of money for
them. However it is a matter of congratulation that goods do arrive
without fail in this region of Pâtâla, at the other end of the globe. I
shall let you know as soon as the goods come. Now keep quiet for at
least three months. </p>
<p>Now is the time for you to apply yourself to start the
magazine. Tell Ramdayal Babu that though the gentleman of whom he
speaks be a competent person, I am not in a position to have anybody in
America at present. . . . What about your article on Tibet? When it is
published in the <i>Mirror</i>, send me a copy. . . .<!--'Volume 6 Page 297'-->
Come, here is a task for you, conduct that magazine. Thrust it on
people and make them subscribe to it, and don't be afraid. What work do
you expect from men of little hearts? &#8212; Nothing in the world! You must
have an iron will if you would cross the ocean. You must be strong
enough to pierce mountains. I am coming next winter. We shall set the

edition indeed; but people of this country have not the least

interested in the study of Sanskrit. Give my special thanks to the

for these things if they be sent from house to house, in small packets,

</body></html>",5901,"DEAR SARADA,

Your two letters are to hand, as also the two of Ramdayal Babu. I have got the bill of lading; but it will be long before the goods arrive. Unless one arranges for the prompt despatch of goods they take about six months to come. It is four months since Haramohan wrote that the Rudrâksha beads and Kusha mats had been despatched, but there is no news of their whereabouts yet. The thing is, when the goods reach England, the agent of the company here gives me notice; and about a month later, the goods arrive. I received your bill of lading about three weeks ago, but no sign of the notice! Only the goods sent by Raja of Khetri arrive quickly. Most probably he spends a lot of money for them. However it is a matter of congratulation that goods do arrive without fail in this region of Pâtâla, at the other end of the globe. I shall let you know as soon as the goods come. Now keep quiet for at least three months.

Now is the time for you to apply yourself to start the magazine. Tell Ramdayal Babu that though the gentleman of whom he speaks be a competent person, I am not in a position to have anybody in America at present. . . . What about your article on Tibet? When it is published in theMirror, send me a copy. . . .Come, here is a task for you, conduct that magazine. Thrust it on people and make them subscribe to it, and don't be afraid. What work do you expect from men of little hearts? — Nothing in the world! You must have an iron will if you would cross the ocean. You must be strong enough to pierce mountains. I am coming next winter. We shall set the world on fire — let those who will, join us and be blessed, and those that won't come, will lag behind for ever and ever; let them do so. You gird up your loins and keep yourself ready . . . . Never mind anything! In your lips and hands the Goddess of Learning will make Her seat; the Lord of infinite power will be seated on your chest; you will do works that will strike the world with wonder. By the bye, can't you shorten your name a bit, my boy? What a long, long name — a single name enough to fill a volume! Well, you hear people say that the Lord's name keeps away death! It is not the simple name Hari, mind you.

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>I am astonished to hear the scandals the Ramabai circles are
indulging in about me. Don't you see, Mrs. Bull, that however a man may
conduct himself, there will always be persons who invent the blackest
lies about him? At Chicago I had such things every day against me. And
these women are invariably the very Christian of Christians! . . . I am
going to have a series of paid lectures in my rooms (downstairs), which
will seat about a hundred persons, and that will cover the expenses. I
am in no great hurry about the money to be sent to India. I will wait.
Is Miss Farmer with you? Is Mrs. Peake at Chicago? Have you seen
Josephine Locke? Miss Hamlin has been very kind to me and does all she
can to help me. </p>
<p>My master used to say that these names, as Hindu, Christian,
etc., stand as great bars to all brotherly feelings between man and
man. We must try to break them down first. They have lost all their
good powers and now only stand as baneful influences under whose black
magic even the best of us behave like demons. Well, we will have to
work hard and must succeed. </p>
<p>That<a name=""from_east_west""></a> is why I desire so much to have a centre. Organisation
has its faults, no doubt, but without that nothing can be done. And
here, I am afraid, I will have to differ from you &#8212; that no one ever
succeeded in keeping society in good humour and at the same time did
great works. One must work as the dictate comes from within, and then
if it is light and good, society is bound to veer round, perhaps
centuries after one is dead and gone. We must plunge heart and soul and
body into the work. And until we be ready to sacrifice everything<!--'Volume 6 Page 302'-->
else to one <i>Idea</i> and to one alone, we <i>never</i>,
<i>never</i> will see the light. </p>
<p>Those that want to help mankind must take their own pleasure
and pain, name and fame, and all sorts of interests, and make a bundle
of them and throw them into the sea, and then come to the Lord. This is
what all the Masters <i>said</i> and <i>did</i>.
</p>
<p>I went to Miss Corbin's last Saturday and told her that I
should not be able to come to hold classes any more. Was it ever in the
history of the world that any great work was done by the rich? It is
the heart and the brain that do it ever and ever and not the purse. </p>

<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>. . . You write that you have recovered from your illness; but
you must henceforth be very careful. Late dinners or unwholesome food,
or living in a stinking place may bring on a relapse, and make it hard
to escape the clutches of malaria. First of all you should hire a small
garden-house &#8212; you may get one for thirty or forty rupees. Secondly,
see that cooking and drinking water be filtered &#8212; a bamboo filter of a
big size will do. Water is the cause of all sorts of disease. It is not
the clearness or dirtiness of water, but its being full of disease
germs, that causes disease. Let the water be boiled and filtered. You
must all pay attention to your health first. A cook, a servant, clean
beds, and timely meals &#8212; these are absolutely necessary. Please see
that all these suggestions be carried out <i>in toto</i>.
. . . The success of your undertakings depends wholly upon your mutual
love. There is no good in store so long as malice and jealousy and
egotism will prevail. ... Kali's pamphlet is very well written and has
no exaggerations. Know that talking ill of others in private is a sin.
You must wholly avoid it. Many things may occur to the mind, but it
gradually makes a mountain of a molehill if you try to express<!--'Volume 6 Page 305'-->
them. Everything is ended if you forgive and forget. It is welcome news
that Shri Ramakrishna's festival was celebrated with great éclat. You
must try so that there is a muster of a hundred thousand people next
year. Put your energies together to start a magazine. Shyness won't do
any more.... He who has infinite patience and infinite energy at his
back, will alone succeed. You must pay special attention to study. Do
you understand? You must not huddle together too many fools. I shall be
glad if you bring together a few real men. Why, I don't hear even a
single one opening his lips. You distributed sweets at the festival,
and there was singing by some parties, mostly idlers. True, but I don't
hear what spiritual food you have given. So long as that <i>nil
admirari</i> attitude is not gone, you will not be able to do
anything, and none of you will have courage. Bullies are always
cowards. </p>
<p>Take up everyone with sympathy, whether he believes in Shri
Ramakrishna or not. If anybody comes to you for vain dispute, politely
withdraw yourselves. ... You must express your sympathy with people of
all sects. When these cardinal virtues will be manifested in you, then
only you will be able to work with great energy. Otherwise, mere taking
the name of the Guru will not do. However, there is no doubt that this
year's festival has been a great success, and you deserve special
thanks for it; but you must push forward, do you see? What is Sharat
doing? Never shall you be able to know anything if you persist in
pleading ignorance. ... We want something of a higher tone &#8212; that will
appeal to the intellect of the learned. It won't do merely to get up
musical parties and all that. Not only will this festival be his
memorial, but also the central union of an intense propaganda of his
doctrines. ... All will come in good time. But at times I fret and
stamp like a leashed hound. Onward and forward, my old watchword. I am
doing well.<!--'Volume 6 Page 306'--> No use going back to

<i>25th April, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>The day before yesterday I received a kind note from Miss
Farmer including a cheque for a hundred dollars for the Barbar House
lectures. She is coming to New York next Saturday. I will of course
tell her to put my name in her circulars; and what is more, I cannot go
to Greenacre now; I have arranged to go to the Thousand Islands,
wherever that may be. There is a cottage belonging to Miss Dutcher, one
of my students, and a few of us will be there in rest and peace and
seclusion. I want to manufacture a few ""Yogis"" out of the materials of
the classes, and a busy farm like Greenacre is the last place for that,
while the other is quite out of the way, and none of the
curiosity-seekers will dare go there. </p>
<p>I am very glad that Miss Hamlin took down the names of the 130
persons who come to the Jnana-Yoga class. There are 50 more who come to
the Wednesday Yoga class and about 50 more to the Monday class. Mr.
Landsberg had all the names; and they will come anyhow, names or no
names.... If they do not, others will, and so it will go on &#8212; the Lord
be praised. </p>
<p>Taking down names and giving notices is a big task, no doubt,
and I am very thankful to both of them for doing that for me. But I am
thoroughly persuaded that it is laziness on my part, and therefore
immoral, to depend on others, and always evil comes out of laziness. So
henceforth I will do it all myself. ... </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 307'-->
<p>However, I will be only too glad to take in any one of Miss
Hamlin's ""right sort of persons"", but unfortunately for me, not one
such has as yet turned up. <a name=""from_east_west""></a>It is the duty of the teacher always to turn
the ""right sort"" out of the most ""unrighteous sort"" of persons. After
all, though I am very, very grateful to the young lady, Miss Hamlin,
for the great hope and encouragement she gave me of introducing me to
the ""right sort of New Yorkers"" and for the practical help she has
given me, I think I hard better do my little work with my own hands. .
. . </p>
<p>I am only glad that you have such a great opinion about Miss
Hamlin. I for one am glad to know that you will help her, for she
requires it. But, mother, through the mercy of Ramakrishna, my instinct
""sizes up"" almost infallibly a human face as soon as I see it, and the
result is this: you may do anything you please with my affairs, <i>I
will not even murmur</i>; &#8212; I will be only too glad to take Miss
Farmer's advice, in spite of ghosts and spooks. Behind the spooks I <i>see</i>
a heart of immense love, only covered with a thin film of <i>laudable</i>
ambition &#8212; even that is bound to vanish in a few years. Even I will
allow Landsberg to ""monkey"" with my affairs from time to time; but here
I put a full stop. Help from any other persons besides these <i>frightens</i>
me. That is all I can say. Not only for the help you have given me, but
from my instinct (or, as I call it, inspiration of my <i>Master</i>),
I regard you as my mother and will always abide by any advice you may
have for me &#8212; but only personally. When you select a medium, I will beg
leave to exercise my choice. That is all. </p>
<p>Herewith I send the English gentleman's letter. I have made a
few notes on the margin to explain Hindustani words.</p>

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>I am here at last with Mr. Leggett. This is one of the most
beautiful spots I have ever seen. Imagine a lake, surrounded with hills
covered with a huge forest, with nobody but ourselves. So lovely, so
quiet, so restful! And you may imagine how glad I am to be here after
the bustle of cities. </p>
<p>It gives me a new lease of life to be here. I go into the
forest alone and read my Gita and am quite happy. I will leave this
place in about ten days and go to the Thousand Island Park. I will
meditate by the hour there and be all alone to myself. The very idea is
ennobling. </p>

<p>I have just arrived home. The trip did me good, and I enjoyed
the country and the hills, and especially Mr. Leggett's country-house
in New York State. Poor Landsberg<!--'Volume 6 Page 310'-->

<p>DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>. . . I am quite in agreement with what Sarada is doing, but
it is not necessary to preach that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was an
Incarnation, and things of that sort. He came to do good to the world;
not to trumpet his own name &#8212; you must always remember this. Disciples
pay their whole attention to the preservation of their master's name
and throw overboard his teachings; and sectarianism etc., are the
result. Alasinga writes of Charu; but I do not recollect him. Write all
about him and convey him my thanks. Write in detail about all; I have
no time to spare for idle gossip .... Try to give up ceremonials. They
are not meant for Sannyasins; and one must work only so long as one
does not attain to illumination .... I have nothing to do with
sectarianism. Or party-forming and playing the frog-in-the-well,
whatever else I may do.... It is impossible to preach the catholic
ideas of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and form sects at the same time....
Only one kind of work I understand, and that is doing good to others;
all else<!--'Volume 6 Page 311'--> is doing evil. I
therefore prostrate myself before the Lord Buddha.... I am a Vedantist;
Sachchidananda &#8212; Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute &#8212; is my God. I
scarcely find any other God than the majestic form of my own Self. By
the word ""Incarnation"" are meant those who have attained that
Brahmanhood, in other words, the Jivanmuktas &#8212; those who have realised
this freedom in this very life. I do not find any speciality in
Incarnations: all beings from Brahmâ down to a clump of grass will
attain to liberation-in-life in course of time, and our duty lies in
helping all to reach that state. This help is called religion; the rest
is irreligion. This help is work; the rest is evil-doing &#8212; I see
nothing else. Other kinds of work, for example, the Vaidika or the
Tântrika, may produce results; but resorting to them is simply waste of
life, for that purity which is the goal of work is realisable only
through doing good to others. Through works such as sacrifices etc.,
one may get enjoyments, but it is impossible to have the purity of
soul.... Everything exists already in the Self of all beings. He who
asserts he is free, shall be free. He who says he is bound, bound he
shall remain. To me, the thought of oneself as low and humble is a sin
and ignorance. <span lang=""sa"">""&#2344;&#2366;&#2351;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366; &#2348;&#2354;&#2361;&#2368;&#2344;&#2375;&#2344; &#2354;&#2349;&#2381;&#2351;&#2307;</span>

came to preach, though his advent brought the old truths to light. In
other words, he was the embodiment of all the past religious thoughts
of India. His life alone made me understand what the<!--'Volume 6 Page 312'-->

Shastras. </p>
<p>Missionaries and others could not do much against me in this
country. Through the Lord's grace the people here like me greatly and
are not to be tricked by the opinions of any particular class. They
appreciate my ideas in a manner my own countrymen cannot do, and are
not selfish. I mean, when it comes to practical work they will give up
jealousy and all those ideas of self-sufficiency. Then all of them
agree and act under the direction of a capable man. That is what makes
them so great. But then they are a nation of Mammon-worshippers. Money
comes before everything. People of our country are very liberal in
pecuniary matters, but not so much these people. Every home has a
miser. It is almost a religion here. But they fall into the clutches of
the priests when they do something bad, and then buy their passage to
heaven with money. These things are the same in every country &#8212;
priestcraft. I can say nothing as to whether I shall go back to India
and when. There also I shall have to lead a wandering life as I do
here; but here thousands of people listen to and understand my
lectures, and these thousands are benefited. But can you say the same
thing about India? . . . I am perfectly at one with what Sarada is
doing. A thousand thanks to him.... In Madras and Bombay I have lots of
men who are after my heart. They are learned and understand everything.
Moreover they are kind-hearted and can therefore appreciate the
philanthropic spirit.... I have printed neither books nor anything of
the kind. I simply go on lecturing tours.... When I take a
retrospective view of my past life, I feel no remorse. From country to
country I have travelled teaching something, however little, to people,
and in exchange for that have partaken of their slices of bread. If I
had found I had done no work, but simply supported myself by<!--'Volume 6 Page 313'-->
imposing upon people, I would have committed suicide today. Why do
those who think themselves unfit to teach their fellow-beings, wear the
teacher's garb and earn their bread by cheating them? Is not that a

<p>DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I have now got lots of newspapers etc., and you need not send
any more. Let the movement now confine itself to India.... </p>
<p>It isn't much use getting up a sensation every day. But avail
yourselves of this stir that is rife all over the country, and scatter
yourselves in all quarters. In other words, try to start branches at
different places. Let it not be an empty sound merely. You must join
the Madrasis and start associations etc., at different places. What
about the magazine which I heard was going to be started? Why are you
nervous about conducting it? ... Come? Do something heroic! Brother,
what if you do not attain Mukti, what if you suffer damnation a few
times? Is the saying untrue? &#8212;</p>

<p>&#8212; There are some saints who full of holiness in thought, word,
and deed, please the whole world by their numerous beneficent acts,
and who develop their own hearts by magnifying an atom of virtue in
others as if it were as great as a mountain"" (Bhartrihari, <i>Nitishataka</i>).
</p>
<p>What if you don't get Mukti? What childish prattle! Lord! They
say even the venom of a snake loses its power by firmly denying it.
Isn't it true? What queer humility is this to say, ""I know nothing!""
""I am nothing!"" This is pseudo-renunciation and mock modesty, I tell
you. Off with such a self-debasing spirit! ""If&nbsp;<i>I </i>do
not know, who on earth does!"" What have you been doing so long if you
now plead ignorance? These are the words of an atheist &#8212; the humility
of a vagabond wretch. We can do everything, and will do everything! He
who is fortunate enough will heroically join us, letting the worthless
mew like cats from their corner. A saint writes, ""Well, you have had
enough of blazoning. Now come back home."" I would have called him a man
if he could build a house and call me. Ten years' experience of such
things has made me wiser. I am no more to be duped by words. Let him
who has courage in his mind and love in his heart come with me. I want
none else. Through Mother's grace, single-handed I am worth a hundred
thousand now and will be worth two millions.... There is no certainty
about my going back to India. I shall have to lead a wandering life
there also, as I am doing here. But here one lives in the company of
scholars, and there one must live among fools &#8212; there is this
difference as of the poles. People of this country organise and work,
while <i>our </i>undertakings all come to dust clashing
against laziness &#8212; miscalled ""renunciation,"" &#8212; and jealousy, etc. &#8212;
writes me big letters now and then, half of which I cannot decipher,
which is a blessing to me. For a great part of the news is of the
following description &#8212; that in such and such a place<!--'Volume 6 Page 316'-->
such and such a man was speaking ill of me, and that he, being unable
to bear the same, had a quarrel with him, and so forth. Many thanks for
his kind defence of me. But what seriously hinders me from listening to
what particular people may be saying about me is &#8212; <span lang=""sa"">""&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2354;&#2381;&#2346;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330;

many."" .
. . </p>
<p>An organised society is wanted. Let Shashi look to the
household management, Sanyal take charge of money matters and
marketing, and Sharat act as secretary, that is, carry on
correspondence etc. Make a permanent centre &#8212; it is no use making
random efforts as you are doing now. Do you see my point? I have quite
a heap of newspapers, now I want you to do something. If you can build
a Math, I shall say you are heroes; otherwise you are nothing. Consult
the Madras people when you work. They have a great capacity for work.
Celebrate this year's Shri Ramakrishna festival with such éclat as to
make it a record. The less the feeding propaganda is, the better. It is
enough if you distribute Prasâda in earthen cups to the devotees
standing in rows.... </p>
<p>I am going to write a very short sketch of Shri Ramakrishna's
life in English, which I shall send you. Have it printed and translated
into Bengali and sell it at the festival &#8212; people do not read books
that are distributed free. Fix some nominal price. Have the festival
done with great pomp. . . . </p>
<p>You must have an all-sided intellect to do efficient work. In
any towns or villages you may visit, start an association wherever you
find a number of people revering Shri Ramakrishna. Have you travelled
through so many villages all for nothing? We must slowly absorb the
Hari Sabhâs and such other associations. Well, I cannot tell you all &#8212;
if I could but get another demon like me! The Lord will supply me
everything in time.... If one has got power, one must manifest it in
action. ...<!--'Volume 6 Page 317'-->
Off with your ideas
of Mukti and Bhakti! There is only one way in the world, <span lang=""sa"">""&#2346;&#2352;&#2379;&#2346;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2351; &#2361;&#2367;

for others
alone"", ""The wise man should
sacrifice himself for others"". I can secure my own good only by doing
you good. There is no other way, none whatsoever.... You are God, I am
God, and man is God. It is this God manifested through humanity who is
doing everything in this world. Is there a different God sitting high
up somewhere? To work, therefore! </p>
<p>Bimala has sent me a book written by Shashi (Sanyal). ... From
a perusal of that work Bimala has come to know that all the people of
this world are impure and that they are by their very nature debarred
from having a jot of religion; that only the handful of Brahmins that
are in India have the sole right to it, and among these again, Shashi
(Sanyal) and Bimala are the sun and moon, so to speak. Bravo! What a
powerful religion indeed! In Bengal specially, that sort of religion is
very easy to practice. There is no easier way than that. The whole
truth about austerities and spiritual exercises is, in a nutshell, that
I am pure and all the rest are impure! A beastly, demoniac, hellish
religion this! If the American people are unfit for religion, if it is
improper to preach religion here, why then ask their help? . . . What
can remedy such a disease? Well, tell Shashi (Sanyal) to go to Malabar.
The Raja there has taken his subjects' land and offered it at the feet
of Brahmins. There are big monasteries in every village where sumptuous
dinners are given, supplemented by presents in cash. ... There is no
harm in touching the non-Brahmin classes when it serves one's purpose;
and when you have done with it, you bathe, for the non-Brahmins are as
a class unholy and must never be touched on other occasions! Monks and
Sannyasins and Brahmins of a certain type have thrown the country into
ruin. Intent all the while<!--'Volume 6 Page 318'--> on
theft and wickedness, these pose as preachers of religion! They will
take gifts from the people and at the same time cry, ""Don't touch me!""
And what great things they have been doing! &#8212; ""If a potato happens to
touch a brinjal, how long will the universe last before it is deluged?""
""If they do not apply earth a dozen times to clean their hands, will
fourteen generations of ancestors go to hell, or twenty-four?"" &#8212; For
intricate problems like these they have been finding out scientific
explanations for the last two thousand years &#8212; while one fourth of the
people are starving. A girl of eight is married to a man of thirty, and
the parents are jubilant over it.... And if anyone protests against it,
the plea is put forward, ""Our religion is being overturned."" What sort
of religion have they who want to see their girls becoming mothers
before they attain puberty even and offer scientific explanations for
it? Many, again, lay the blame at the door of the Mohammedans. They are
to blame, indeed! Just read the <i>Grihya-Sutras</i>
through and see what is given as the marriageable age of a girl. ...
There it is expressly stated that a girl must be married before
attaining puberty. The entire <i>Grihya-Sutras</i> enjoin
this. And in the Vedic Ashvamedha sacrifice worse things would be
done.... All the <i>Brâhmanas</i> mention them, and all
the commentators admit them to be true. How can you deny them? </p>
<p>What I mean by mentioning all this is that there were many
good things in the ancient times, but there were bad things too. The
good things are to be retained, but the India that is to be, the future
India, must be much greater than ancient India. From the day Shri
Ramakrishna was born dates the growth of modern India and of the Golden
Age. And you are the agents to bring about this Golden Age. To work,
with this conviction at heart! </p>
<p>Hence, when you call Shri Ramakrishna an Incarnation<!--'Volume 6 Page 319'-->
and in the same breath plead your ignorance unhesitatingly, I say,
""You are false to the backbone!"" If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa be true,
you also are true. But you must show it. ... In you all there is
tremendous power. The atheist has nothing but rubbish in him. Those who
are believers are heroes. They will manifest tremendous power. The
world will be swept before them. ""Sympathy and help to the poor""; ""Man
is God, he is Nârâyana""; ""In Atman there is no distinction of male or
female, of Brahmin or Kshatriya, and the like""; ""All is Narayana from
the Creator down to a clump of grass."" The worm is less manifested, the
Creator more manifested. Every action that helps a being manifest its
divine nature more and more is <i>good</i>, every action
that retards it is <i>evil</i>. </p>
<p>The only way of getting our divine nature manifested is by
helping others to do the same. </p>
<p>If there is inequality in nature, still there must be equal
chance for all &#8212; or if greater for some and for some less &#8212; the weaker
should be given more chance than the strong. </p>
<p>In other words, a Brahmin is not so much in need of education
as a Chandâla. If the son of a Brahmin needs one teacher, that of a
Chandala needs ten. For greater help must be given to him whom nature
has not endowed with an acute intellect from birth. It is a madman who
carries coals to Newcastle. The poor, the downtrodden, the ignorant,
let these be your God. </p>
<p>A dreadful slough is in front of you &#8212; take care; many fall
into it and die. The slough is this, that the present religion of the
Hindus is not in the Vedas, nor in the Puranas, nor in Bhakti, nor in
Mukti &#8212; religion has entered into the cooking-pot. The present religion
of the Hindus is neither the path of knowledge nor that of reason &#8212; it
is ""Don't-touchism"". ""Don't touch me!"" ""Don't touch me!"" &#8212; that
exhausts its description. See that you do<!--'Volume 6 Page 320'-->
not lose your lives in this dire irreligion of ""Don't-touchism"". Must

confined to books alone? How will they grant salvation who cannot feed
a hungry mouth with a crumb of bread? How will those who become impure
at the mere breath of others purify others? Don't-touchism is a form of
mental disease. Beware! All expansion is life, all contraction is
death. All love is expansion, all selfishness is contraction. Love is
therefore the only law of life. He who loves lives, he who is selfish
is dying. Therefore love for love's sake, because it is the only law of
life, just as you breathe to live. This is the secret of selfless love,
selfless action and the rest. ... Try to help Shashi (Sanyal) if you
can, in any way. He is a very good and pious man, but of a narrow
heart. It does not fall to the lot of all to feel for the misery of
others. Good Lord! Of all Incarnations Lord Chaitanya was the greatest,
but he was comparatively lacking in knowledge; in the Ramakrishna
Incarnation there is knowledge, devotion and love &#8212; infinite knowledge,
infinite love, infinite work, infinite compassion for all beings. You
have not yet been able to understand him. <span lang=""sa"">""&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2369;&#2340;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2346;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375;&#2344;&#2306;

It does not fall to the lot of all to feel for the misery of others. Good Lord! Of all Incarnations Lord Chaitanya was the greatest, but he was comparatively lacking in knowledge; in the Ramakrishna Incarnation there is knowledge, devotion and love — infinite knowledge, infinite love, infinite work, infinite compassion for all beings. You have not yet been able to understand him.""श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित्— Even after hearing about Him, most people do not understand Him."" What the whole Hindu race has thought in ages, helivedin one life. His life is the living commentary to theVedasof all nations. People will come to know him by degrees. My old watchword — struggle, struggle up to light! Onward!","Yours in service,

<p>BELOVED AKHANDANANDA,</p>
<p>I am glad to go through the contents of your letter. Your idea
is grand but our nation is totally lacking in the faculty of
organisation. It is this one drawback which produces all sorts of evil.
We are altogether averse to making a common cause for anything. The
first requisite for organisation is obedience. I do a little bit of
work when I feel so disposed, and then let it go to the dogs &#8212; this
kind of work is of no avail. We must have plodding industry and
perseverance. Keep a regular correspondence, I mean, make it a point to
write to me every month, or twice a month, what work you are doing and
what has been its outcome. We want here (in England) a Sannyasin
well-versed in English and Sanskrit. I shall soon go to America again,
and he is to work here in my absence. Except Sharat and Shashi &#8212; I find
no one else for this task. I have sent money to Sharat and written to
him to start at once. I have requested Rajaji that his Bombay agent may
help Sharat in embarking. I forgot to write &#8212; but if you can take the
trouble to do it, please send through Sharat a bag of Mung, gram, and
Arhar Dâl, also a little of the spice called Methi. Please convey my
love to Pundit Narayan Das, Mr. Shankar Lal, Ojhaji, Doctor, and all.
Do you think you can get the medicine for Gopi's eyes here? &#8212;
Everywhere you find patent medicines, which are all humbug. Please give
my blessings to him and to the other boys. Yajneshwar has founded a
certain society at Meerut and wants to work conjointly with us. By the
bye, he has got a certain paper too; send Kali there, and let him start
a Meerut centre, if he can and, try<!--'Volume 6 Page 322'-->
to have a paper in Hindi. I shall help a little now and then. I shall
send some money when Kali goes to Meerut and reports to me exactly how
matters stand. Try to open a centre at Ajmer. ... Pundit Agnihotri has
started some society at Saharanpur. They wrote me a letter. Please keep
in correspondence with them. Live on friendly terms with all. Work!
Work! Go on opening centres in this way. We have them already in
Calcutta and Madras, and it will be excellent if you can start new ones
at Meerut and Ajmer. Go on slowly starting centres at different places
like that. Here all my letters etc., are to be addressed in care of E.
T. Sturdy, Esq., High View, Caversham, Reading, England, and those for
America, C/o Miss Phillips, 19 W. 38 Street, New York. By degrees we
must spread the world over. The first thing needed is obedience. You
must be ready to plunge into fire &#8212; then will work be done. ... Form
societies like that at different villages in Rajputana. There you have

<p>MY DEAR&#8212;, (Brother-disciples at the Math.) </p>
<p>The books that Sanyal sent have arrived. I forgot to mention
this. Please inform him about it. </p>
<p>Let me write down something for you all: </p>
<p>1. Know partiality to be the chief cause of all evil. That is
to say, if you show towards any one more love than towards somebody
else, rest assured, you will be sowing the seeds of future troubles. </p>
<p>2. If anybody comes to you to speak ill of any of his<!--'Volume 6 Page 323'-->
brothers, refuse to listen to him <i>in toto</i>. It is a
great sin to listen even. In that lies the germ of future troubles. </p>
<p>3. Moreover, bear with everyone's shortcomings. Forgive
offences by the million. And if you love all unselfishly, all will by
degrees come to love one another. As soon as they fully understand that
the interests of one depend upon those of others, everyone of them will
give up jealousy. To do something conjointly is not in our very
national character. Therefore you must try to inaugurate that spirit
with the utmost care, and wait patiently. To tell you the truth, I do
not find among you any distinction of great or small: everyone has the
capacity to manifest, in times of need, the highest energy. I see it.
Look for instance how Shashi will remain always constant to his spot;
his steadfastness is a great foundation-rock. How successfully Kali and
Jogen brought about the Town Hall meeting; it was indeed a momentous
task! Niranjan has done much work in Ceylon and elsewhere. How
extensively has Sarada travelled and sown seeds of gigantic future
works! Whenever I think of the wonderful renunciation of Hari, about
his steadiness of intellect and forbearance, I get a new access of
strength! In Tulasi, Gupta, Baburam, Sharat, to mention a few, in every
one of you there is tremendous energy. If you still entertain any doubt
as to Shri Ramakrishna's being a jewel-expert, what then is the
difference between you and a madman! Behold, hundreds of men and women
of this country are beginning to worship our Lord as the greatest of
all Avataras! Steady! Every great work is done slowly. ... </p>
<p>He is at the helm, what fear! You are all of infinite strength
&#8212; how long does it take you to keep off petty jealousy or egoistic
ideas! The moment such propensity comes, resign yourselves to the Lord!
Just make over your<!--'Volume 6 Page 324'--> body and
mind to His work, and all troubles will be at an end for ever. </p>
<p>There will not be room enough, I see, in the house where you
are at present living. A commodious building is needed. That is to say,
you need not huddle together in one room. If possible, not more than
two should live in the same room. There should be a big hall, where the
books may be kept. </p>
<p>Every morning there should be a little reading from the
scriptures, which Kali and others may superintend by turns. In the
evening there should be another class, with a little practice in
meditation and Sankirtanas etc. You may divide the work, and set apart
one day for Yoga, a day for Bhakti, another for Jnâna, and so forth: It
will be excellent if you fix a routine like this, so that outside
people also may join in the evening classes. And every Sunday, from ten
in the morning up till night, there should be a continuous succession
of classes and Sankirtanas etc. That is for the public. If you take the
trouble to continue this kind of routine work for some time, it will
gradually make itself easy and smooth. There should be no smoking in
that hall, for which another place must be set apart. If you can take
trouble to bring about this state of things by degrees, I shall think a
great advance is made. </p>

special love and blessings to Hari Singh and others. Never take part in
quarrels and disputes. Who on earth possesses the power to put the Raja
of Khetri down? &#8212; The Divine Mother is at his elbow! I have received
Kali's letter too. It will be very good indeed if you can start a
centre in Kashmir. Wherever you can, open a centre.... Now I have laid
the foundations firm here and in England, and nobody has the power to
shake them. New York is in a commotion this year. Next year will come
the turn of London. Even big giants will give way, who counts your
pigmies! Gird up your loins and set yourselves to work! We must throw
the world into convulsions with our triumphal shouts. This is but the
beginning, my boy. Do you think there are <i>men</i> in
our country, it is a <i>Golgotha</i>! There is some chance
if you can impart education to the masses. Is there a greater strength
than that of Knowledge? Can you give them education? Name me the
country where rich men ever helped anybody! In all countries it is the
middle classes that do all great works. How long will it take to raise
the money? Where are the <i>men</i>? Are there any in our
country? Our countrymen are boys, and even must treat them as such....
There are some few religious and philosophical books left &#8212; the
remnants of the mansion that has been burnt down; take them with you,
quick and come over to this country. ... </p>

anybody's project. Give up criticism altogether. Help all as long as
you find they are doing all right, and in cases where they seem to be

<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from you in which there was a
smattering of news, but nothing in detail. I am much better now.
Through the grace of the Lord I am proof against the severe cold for
this year. Oh, the terrible cold! But these people keep all down
through scientific knowledge. Every house has its cellar underground,
in which there is a big boiler whence steam is made to course day and
night through every room. This keeps all the rooms warm, but it has one
defect, that while it is summer indoors, it is 30 to 40 degrees below
zero outside! Most of the rich people of this country make for Europe
during the winter, which is comparatively warm. </p>
<p>Now, let me give you some instructions. This letter is meant
for you. Please go through these instructions once a day and act up to
them. I have got Sarada's letter &#8212; he is<!--'Volume 6 Page 327'-->
doing good work &#8212; but now we want organization. To him, Brother Tarak,
and others please give my special love and blessings. The reason why I
give you these few instructions is that there is an organising power in
you &#8212; the Lord has made this known to me &#8212; but it is not yet fully
developed. Through His blessings it will soon be. That you never lose
your centre of gravity is an evidence of this, but it must be both
intensive and extensive. </p>
<p>1. All the Shâstras hold that the threefold misery that there
is in this world is not natural, hence it is removable. </p>
<p>2. In the Buddha Incarnation the Lord says that the root of
the Âdhibhautika misery or, misery arising from other terrestrial
beings, is the formation of <i>classes</i> (Jâti); in
other words, every form of class-distinction, whether based on birth,
or acquirements, or wealth is at the bottom of this misery. In the

not sent those papers to this country, tell him not to do it. Only the
Address will do, I do not want the proceedings. Now many respectable
ladies and gentlemen of this country hold me in reverence. The
missionaries and others of that ilk have tried their utmost to put me
down, but finding it useless have now become quiet. Every undertaking
must pass through a lot of obstacles. Truth triumphs if only one
pursues a peaceful course. I have no need to reply to what a Mr. Hudson
has spoken against me. In the first place, it is unnecessary, and
secondly, I shall be bringing myself down to the level of people of Mr.
Hudson's type. Are you mad? Shall I fight from here with one Mr.
Hudson? Through the Lord's grace, people who are far above Mr. Hudson
in rank listen to me with veneration. Please do not send any more
papers. Let all that go on in India, it will do no harm. For the Lord's
work at one time there was need for that kind of newspaper blazoning.
When that is done, there is no more need for it. . . . It is one of the
attendant evils of name and fame that you can't have anything private.
. . . Before you begin any undertaking, pray to Shri Ramakrishna, and
he will show you the right way. We want<!--'Volume 6 Page 330'-->
a big plot of land to begin with, then building and all will come.

wishes to all. Work in unison with the people of Madras, and let
someone or other amongst you go there at intervals. Give up for ever
the desire for name and fame and power. While I am on earth, Shri
Ramakrishna is working through me. So long as you believe in this there
is no danger of any evil for you. </p>
<p>The <i>Ramakrishna Punthi</i> (Life of Shri
Ramakrishna in Bengali verse) that Akshaya has sent is very good, but
there is no glorification of the <i>Shakti</i> at the

extremely difficult to write a flowery style in a foreign tongue.

I am not writing any book on Hinduism at present. But I am jotting down
my thoughts. Every religion is an expression, a language to express the
same truth, and we must speak to each in his own language. That Sarada
has grasped this, is all right. It will be time enough to look to
Hinduism later on. Do you think people in this country would be much
attracted if I talk of Hinduism? &#8212; The very name of narrowness in ideas
will scare them away! The real thing is &#8212; <i>the Religion</i>

I have very little time to write &#8212; always lecture, lecture, lecture.
Purity, Patience, Perseverance.... You must ask those numerous people
who are now paying heed to Shri Ramakrishna's teachings, to help you
pecuniarily to a certain extent. How can the Math be maintained unless
they help you? You must not be shy of making this plain to all. ... </p>
<p>There is no gain in hastening my return from this country. In
the first place, a little sound made here will resound there a great
deal. Then, the people of this country are immensely rich and are bold
enough to pay. While the people of our country have neither money nor
the least bit of boldness. </p>
<p>You will know everything by degrees. Was Shri Ramakrishna the
Saviour of India merely? It is this narrow idea that has brought about
India's ruin, and her welfare is an impossibility so long as this is
not rooted out. Had I the money I would send each one of you to travel
all over the world. No great idea can have a place in the heart unless
one steps out of his little corner. It will be verified in time. Every
great achievement is done slowly. Such is the Lord's will. ... </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 332'-->
<p>Why didn't any of you write about Daksha and Harish? I shall
be glad to know if you watch their whereabouts. That Sanyal is feeling
miserable is because his mind is not yet pure like the water of the
Ganga. It is not yet selfless, but will be in time. He will have no
misery if he can give up the little crookedness and be straightforward.
My special loving greetings to Rakhal and Hari. Take great care of
them. ... Never forget that Rakhal was the special object of Shri
Ramakrishna's love. Let nothing daunt you. Who on earth has the power
to snub us so long as the Lord favours us? Even if you are at your last
breath, be not afraid. Work on with the intrepidity of a lion but, at
the same time with the tenderness of a flower. Let this year's Shri
Ramakrishna festival be celebrated in great pomp. Let the feeding be
quite ordinary &#8212; Prasâda being distributed in earthen plates among the

us in celebrating the &#8212;&#8212;th anniversary of Bhagavan Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa. For the celebration of this great occasion and for the
maintenance of the Alambazar Math funds are absolutely necessary. If
you think that the cause is worthy of your sympathy, we shall be very
grateful to receive your contribution to the great work. </p>
<p>Yours obediently, </p>
<p class=""right"">(Name)</p>
<p>If you get more than enough money, spend only a little of it
and keep the surplus as a reserve fund to defray your expenses. On the
plea of offering the food to the Lord, do not make everybody wait till
he is sick, to have a stale and unsavoury dinner. Have two filters made
and use that filtered water for both cooking and drinking purposes.
Boil the water before filtering. If you do this, you will never more
hear of malaria. Keep a strict eye on everybody's health. If you can
give up lying on the floor &#8212; in other words, if you can get the money
to do it, it will be excellent indeed. Dirty clothes are the chief
cause of disease. ... About the food offering, let me tell you that
only a little Payasânna (milk-rice with sugar) will do. He used to love
that alone. It is true that the worship-room is a help to many, but it
is no use indulging in Râjasika and Tâmasika food. Let the ceremonials
give place to a certain extent to a little study of the Gita or the
Upanishads or other sacred books. What I mean is this &#8212; let there be as
little materialism as possible, with the maximum of spirituality. . . .
Did Shri Ramakrishna come for this or that particular individual, or
for the world at large? If the latter, then you must present him in
such a light that the whole world may understand him. . . . <i>You
must not identify yourselves with any life of his written by anybody
nor give your sanction to any</i>. There is no danger so long as
such books do not<!--'Volume 6 Page 334'--> come out
associated with our name. . . . ""Say yea, yea, to all and stick to your
own."" </p>
<p>. . . A thousand thanks to Mahendra Babu for his kindly
helping us. He is a very liberal-hearted man. ... About Sanyal, he will
attain the highest good by doing his bit of work attentively, that is,
by simply serving Shri Ramakrishna's children. . . . Brother Tarak is
doing very good work. Bravo! Well done! That is what we want. Let me
see all of you shoot like so many meteors! What is Gangadhar doing?
Some Zemindars in Rajputana respect him. Tell him to get some money
from them as Bhikshâ; then he is a man. ... </p>
<p>Just now I read Akshaya's book. Give him a hundred thousand
hearty embraces from me. Through his pen Shri Ramakrishna is
manifesting himself. Blessed is Akshaya! Let him recite that <i>Punthi</i>
before all. He must recite it before all in the Festival. If the work
be too large, let him read extracts of it. Well, I do not find a single
irrelevant word in it. I cannot tell in words the joy I have
experienced by reading his book. Try all of you to give the book an
extensive sale. Then ask Akshaya to go from village to village to
preach. Well done Akshaya! He is doing his work. Go from village to
village and proclaim to all Shri Ramakrishna's teachings, can there be
a more blessed lot than this? I tell you, Akshaya's book and Akshaya
himself must electrify the masses. Dear, dear, Akshaya, I bless you
with all my heart, my dear brother. May the Lord sit in your tongue! Go
and spread his teachings from door to door. There is no need whatever
of your becoming a Sannyasin. . . . Akshaya is the future apostle for
the masses of Bengal. Take great care of Akshaya; his faith and
devotion have borne fruit. </p>
<p>Ask Akshaya to write these few points in the third section of
his book, ""The Propagation of the Faith"". </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 335'-->
<p>1. Whatever the Vedas, the Vedanta, and all other Incarnations
have done in the past, Shri Ramakrishna lived to practice in the course
of a single life. </p>
<p>2. One cannot understand the Vedas, the Vedanta, the
Incarnations, and so forth, without understanding <i>his</i>
life. For he was the explanation. </p>
<p>3. From the very date that he was born, has sprung the
Satya-Yuga (Golden Age). Henceforth there is an end to all sorts of
distinctions, and everyone down to the Chandâla will be a sharer in the
Divine Love. The distinction between man and woman, between the rich
and the poor, the literate and illiterate, Brahmins and Chandalas &#8212; he
lived to root out all. And he was the harbinger of Peace &#8212; the
separation between Hindus and Mohammedans, between Hindus and
Christians, all are now things of the past. That fight about
distinctions that there was, belonged to another era. In this
Satya-Yuga the tidal wave of Shri Ramakrishna's Love has unified all. </p>
<p>Tell him to expand these ideas and write them in his own
style. </p>
<p>Whoever &#8212; man or woman &#8212; will worship Shri Ramakrishna, be he
or she ever so low, will be then and there converted into the very
highest. Another thing, the Motherhood of God is prominent in this
Incarnation. He used to dress himself as a woman &#8212; he was, as it were,
our Mother &#8212; and we must likewise look upon all women as the
reflections of the Mother. In India there are two great evils.
Trampling on the women, and grinding the poor through caste
restrictions. He was the Saviour of women, Saviour of the masses,
Saviour of all, high and low. And let Akshaya introduce his worship in
every home &#8212; Brahmin or Chandala, man or woman &#8212; everyone has the right
to worship him. Whoever will worship him only with devotion shall be
blessed for ever. </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 336'-->

Lord will be at his side. </p>

Yesterday I received a letter from you in which there was a smattering of news, but nothing in detail. I am much better now. Through the grace of the Lord I am proof against the severe cold for this year. Oh, the terrible cold! But these people keep all down through scientific knowledge. Every house has its cellar underground, in which there is a big boiler whence steam is made to course day and night through every room. This keeps all the rooms warm, but it has one defect, that while it is summer indoors, it is 30 to 40 degrees below zero outside! Most of the rich people of this country make for Europe during the winter, which is comparatively warm.

Now, let me give you some instructions. This letter is meant for you. Please go through these instructions once a day and act up to them. I have got Sarada's letter — he isdoing good work — but now we want organization. To him, Brother Tarak, and others please give my special love and blessings. The reason why I give you these few instructions is that there is an organising power in you — the Lord has made this known to me — but it is not yet fully developed. Through His blessings it will soon be. That you never lose your centre of gravity is an evidence of this, but it must be both intensive and extensive.

1. All the Shâstras hold that the threefold misery that there is in this world is not natural, hence it is removable.

2. In the Buddha Incarnation the Lord says that the root of the Âdhibhautika misery or, misery arising from other terrestrial beings, is the formation ofclasses(Jâti); in other words, every form of class-distinction, whether based on birth, or acquirements, or wealth is at the bottom of this misery. In the Atman there is no distinction of sex, orVarna1orAshrama,2or anything of the kind, and as mud cannot be washed away by mud, it is likewise impossible to bring about oneness by means of separative ideas.

3. In the Krishna Incarnation He says that the root of all sorts of misery is Avidyâ (Nescience) and that selfless work purifies the mind. But""किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः— Even sages are bewildered to decide what is work and what is no-work"" (Gita).

4. Only that kind of work which develops our spirituality is work. Whatever fosters materiality is no-work.

5. Therefore work and no-work must be regulated by a person's aptitude, his country, and his age.

6. Works such as sacrifices were suited to the olden times but are not for the modern times.

7. From the date that the Ramakrishna Incarnationwas born, has sprung the Satya-Yuga (Golden Age) . . . .

8. In this Incarnation atheistic ideas ... will be destroyed by the sword of Jnana (knowledge), and the whole world will be unified by means of Bhakti (devotion) and Prema (Divine Love). Moreover, in this Incarnation, Rajas, or the desire for name and fame etc., is altogether absent. In other words, blessed is he who acts up to His teachings; whether he accepts Him or not, does not matter.

9. The founders of different sects, in the ancient or modern times, have not been in the wrong. They have done well, but they must do better. Well — better — best.

10. Therefore we must take all up where they are, that is, we must lead them on to higher and higher ideals, without upsetting their own chosen attitude. As to social conditions, those that prevail now are good, but they shall be better — best.

11. There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing.

12. Hence, in the Ramakrishna Incarnation the acceptance of a woman as the Guru, hence His practicing in the woman's garb and frame ofmind,3hence too His preaching the motherhood of women as representations of the Divine Mother.

13. Hence it is that my first endeavour is to start a Math for women. This Math shall be the origin of Gârgis and Maitreyis, and women of even higher attainments than these. . . .

14. No great work can be achieved by humbug. It is through love, a passion for truth, and tremendous energy, that all undertakings are accomplished.तत् कुरु पौरूषम्— Therefore, manifest your manhood.

15. There is no need for quarrel or dispute with anybody. Give your message and leave others to their own thoughts.""सत्यमेव जयते नानृतम्— Truth alone triumphs, not falsehood.""तदा किं विवादेन— Why then fight?

. . . Combine seriousness with childlikenaïveté. Live in harmony with all. Give up all idea of egoism, and entertain no sectarian views. Useless wrangling is a great sin.

Only you must proceed slowly.""शनैः पन्थाः— One must make journeys slowly."" Give my blessings to Dinanath, the new recruit. I have very little time to write — always lecture, lecture, lecture. Purity, Patience, Perseverance.... You must ask those numerous people who are now paying heed to Shri Ramakrishna's teachings, to help you pecuniarily to a certain extent. How can the Math be maintained unless they help you? You must not be shy of making this plain to all. ...

There is no gain in hastening my return from this country. In the first place, a little sound made here will resound there a great deal. Then, the people of this country are immensely rich and are bold enough to pay. While the people of our country have neither money nor the least bit of boldness.

You will know everything by degrees. Was Shri Ramakrishna the Saviour of India merely? It is this narrow idea that has brought about India's ruin, and her welfare is an impossibility so long as this is not rooted out. Had I the money I would send each one of you to travel all over the world. No great idea can have a place in the heart unless one steps out of his little corner. It will be verified in time. Every great achievement is done slowly. Such is the Lord's will. ...

Why didn't any of you write about Daksha and Harish? I shall be glad to know if you watch their whereabouts. That Sanyal is feeling miserable is because his mind is not yet pure like the water of the Ganga. It is not yet selfless, but will be in time. He will have no misery if he can give up the little crookedness and be straightforward. My special loving greetings to Rakhal and Hari. Take great care of them. ... Never forget that Rakhal was the special object of Shri Ramakrishna's love. Let nothing daunt you. Who on earth has the power to snub us so long as the Lord favours us? Even if you are at your last breath, be not afraid. Work on with the intrepidity of a lion but, at the same time with the tenderness of a flower. Let this year's Shri Ramakrishna festival be celebrated in great pomp. Let the feeding be quite ordinary — Prasâda being distributed in earthen plates among the devotees standing in rows. There should be readings from Shri Ramakrishna's Life. Place books like the Vedas and the Vedanta together and perform Ârati before them. . . . Avoid issuing invitation cards of the old style.""आमन्त्रये भवन्तं साशीर्वादं भगवतो रामकृष्णस्य बहुमानपुर:सरञ्च— With Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna's blessings and our great esteem we have the pleasure to invite you."" Write some such line, and then write that to defray the expenses of Shri Ramakrishna's Birthday Festival and those of the maintenance of the Math, you want his assistance. That if he likes, he may kindly send the money to such and such, at such and such address, and so on. Also add a page in English. The term ""Lord Ramakrishna"" has no meaning. You must give it up. Write ""Bhagavan"" in English characters, and add a line or two in English:

THE ANNIVERSARY OF BHAGAVAN SHRI RAMAKRISHNA

Sir, we have great pleasure in inviting you to joinus in celebrating the ——th anniversary of Bhagavan Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. For the celebration of this great occasion and for the maintenance of the Alambazar Math funds are absolutely necessary. If you think that the cause is worthy of your sympathy, we shall be very grateful to receive your contribution to the great work.

Yours obediently,

If you get more than enough money, spend only a little of it and keep the surplus as a reserve fund to defray your expenses. On the plea of offering the food to the Lord, do not make everybody wait till he is sick, to have a stale and unsavoury dinner. Have two filters made and use that filtered water for both cooking and drinking purposes. Boil the water before filtering. If you do this, you will never more hear of malaria. Keep a strict eye on everybody's health. If you can give up lying on the floor — in other words, if you can get the money to do it, it will be excellent indeed. Dirty clothes are the chief cause of disease. ... About the food offering, let me tell you that only a little Payasânna (milk-rice with sugar) will do. He used to love that alone. It is true that the worship-room is a help to many, but it is no use indulging in Râjasika and Tâmasika food. Let the ceremonials give place to a certain extent to a little study of the Gita or the Upanishads or other sacred books. What I mean is this — let there be as little materialism as possible, with the maximum of spirituality. . . . Did Shri Ramakrishna come for this or that particular individual, or for the world at large? If the latter, then you must present him in such a light that the whole world may understand him. . . .You must not identify yourselves with any life of his written by anybody nor give your sanction to any. There is no danger so long as such books do notcome out associated with our name. . . . ""Say yea, yea, to all and stick to your own.""

. . . A thousand thanks to Mahendra Babu for his kindly helping us. He is a very liberal-hearted man. ... About Sanyal, he will attain the highest good by doing his bit of work attentively, that is, by simply serving Shri Ramakrishna's children. . . . Brother Tarak is doing very good work. Bravo! Well done! That is what we want. Let me see all of you shoot like so many meteors! What is Gangadhar doing? Some Zemindars in Rajputana respect him. Tell him to get some money from them as Bhikshâ; then he is a man. ...

Just now I read Akshaya's book. Give him a hundred thousand hearty embraces from me. Through his pen Shri Ramakrishna is manifesting himself. Blessed is Akshaya! Let him recite thatPunthibefore all. He must recite it before all in the Festival. If the work be too large, let him read extracts of it. Well, I do not find a single irrelevant word in it. I cannot tell in words the joy I have experienced by reading his book. Try all of you to give the book an extensive sale. Then ask Akshaya to go from village to village to preach. Well done Akshaya! He is doing his work. Go from village to village and proclaim to all Shri Ramakrishna's teachings, can there be a more blessed lot than this? I tell you, Akshaya's book and Akshaya himself must electrify the masses. Dear, dear, Akshaya, I bless you with all my heart, my dear brother. May the Lord sit in your tongue! Go and spread his teachings from door to door. There is no need whatever of your becoming a Sannyasin. . . . Akshaya is the future apostle for the masses of Bengal. Take great care of Akshaya; his faith and devotion have borne fruit.

Ask Akshaya to write these few points in the third section of his book, ""The Propagation of the Faith"".

1. Whatever the Vedas, the Vedanta, and all other Incarnations have done in the past, Shri Ramakrishna lived to practice in the course of a single life.

2. One cannot understand the Vedas, the Vedanta, the Incarnations, and so forth, without understandinghislife. For he was the explanation.

3. From the very date that he was born, has sprung the Satya-Yuga (Golden Age). Henceforth there is an end to all sorts of distinctions, and everyone down to the Chandâla will be a sharer in the Divine Love. The distinction between man and woman, between the rich and the poor, the literate and illiterate, Brahmins and Chandalas — he lived to root out all. And he was the harbinger of Peace — the separation between Hindus and Mohammedans, between Hindus and Christians, all are now things of the past. That fight about distinctions that there was, belonged to another era. In this Satya-Yuga the tidal wave of Shri Ramakrishna's Love has unified all.

Tell him to expand these ideas and write them in his own style.

Whoever — man or woman — will worship Shri Ramakrishna, be he or she ever so low, will be then and there converted into the very highest. Another thing, the Motherhood of God is prominent in this Incarnation. He used to dress himself as a woman — he was, as it were, our Mother — and we must likewise look upon all women as the reflections of the Mother. In India there are two great evils. Trampling on the women, and grinding the poor through caste restrictions. He was the Saviour of women, Saviour of the masses, Saviour of all, high and low. And let Akshaya introduce his worship in every home — Brahmin or Chandala, man or woman — everyone has the right to worship him. Whoever will worship him only with devotion shall be blessed for ever.

Tell him to write in this strain. Never mind anything — the Lord will be at his side.","Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.","PS. ... Ask Sanyal to send me a copy each of theNâradaandShândilya Sutras, and one of theYogavâsishtha, that has been translated in Calcutta. I want the English translation of the last, not a Bengali edition....",3147,3,35

<p>DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>Glad to receive your letters. There are two defects in the
letters which you all write, specially in yours. The first is that very
few of the important points I ask are answered. Secondly, there is
unusual delay in replying. . . . I have to work day and night, and am
always whirling from place to place besides.... These are countries
where the people are most luxurious, fashionable folk, and nobody would
touch a man who has but a speck of dirt on his body. ... I hoped that
somebody would come while I was still here, but as yet nothing has been
settled I see. ... Business is business, that is, you must do
everything promptly; delay and shuffling won't do. By the end of next
week I shall go to America, so there is no chance of my meeting him who
is coming. . . . These are countries of gigantic scholars. Is it a joke
to make disciples of such people? You are but children and talk like
children. Only this much is needed that there should be someone to
teach a little Sanskrit, or translate a bit in my absence, that's all.
Why not let Girish Babu visit these lands? It is a good idea. It will
cost him but 3000 rupees to visit England and<!--'Volume 6 Page 337'-->
America, and go back. The more people come to these countries, the
better. But then it sets my nerves on edge to look at those who don
hats and pose as <i>Sahibs</i>! </p>
<p>Black as chimney sweeps, and calling themselves Europeans! Why
not wear one's country-dress, as befits gentlemen? &#8212; Instead of that,
to add to that frightfulness of appearance! Good heavens! . . . Here,
as in our country one has to spend from one's own pocket to give
lectures, but one can make good the expenses if one lives long enough
and makes a reputation. Another thing, my incessant lecturing tours are
making my constitution very nervous, causing insomnia and other
troubles. Over and above that, I have to work single-handed. It is no
use depending on my countrymen. No one (in Bengal) has hitherto helped
me with a penny, nor has a single soul stepped forward to my
assistance. Everybody in this world seeks help, and the more you help
him, the more he wants. And if you can do no further, he will call you
a cheat.... I love &#8212; and trust him.... He will be free from disease
through the Lord's grace. I take all his responsibility. . .

<p>DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>. . . I am in receipt of Rakhal's letter today. I am sorry to
hear that &#8212; has suffered from gravel. Most probably it was due to
indigestion. Gopal's debts have been cleared; now ask him to join the
monastic order. The worldly-wise instinct is most difficult to root
out. . . . Let him come and work in the Math. One is apt to imbibe<!--'Volume 6 Page 338'-->
a lot of mischievous ideas by concerning oneself too long in worldly
affairs. If he refuses to take the monastic vow, please tell him to
clear out. I don't want amphibious type of men who will be half monks
and half householders. . . . Haramohan has coined a <i>Lord</i>
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, I see. What does he mean? English Lord, or
Duke? Tell Rakhal, let people say whatever they will &#8212; ""Men (who
wrongly criticise) are to be treated as worms!"" as Shri Ramakrishna
used to say. Let there be no disparity between what you profess and
what you do, also eschew the very name of Jesuitism. Was I ever an
orthodox, Paurânika Hindu, an adherent of social usages? I do not pose
as one. You will not have to say things that will be <i>pleasant</i>
to any section of people. You must not so much as notice what the
Bengalis say for or against us. . . . They could not do a penny-worth
of service to him whose birth has sanctified their country where the
primary laws of health and sanitation are trampled, and yet they would
talk big! What matters is, my brother, what such men have got to say! .
. . It is for you to go on doing your own work. Why look up to men for
approbation, look up to God! I hope Sharat will be able to teach them
the Gita and the Upanishads and their commentaries somehow, with the
help of the dictionary. &#8212; Or, is it an empty Vairâgya that you have?
The days of such Vairagya are gone! It is not for everyone, my boy, to
become Ramakrishna Paramahamsa! I hope Sharat has started by this time.
Please send a copy of the <i>Panchadashi</i>, a copy of
the Gita (with as many commentaries as possible), a copy each of the <i>Nârada</i>
and <i>Shândilya Sutras</i> (published in Varanasi), a
translation (good, not worthless) of the <i>Panchadashi</i>
&#8212; if it is available &#8212; and the translation by Kâlivara Vedântavâgisha
of Shankara's Commentary. And if there be any translation, Bengali or
English (by Shrish Babu of Allahabad), of Pânini's Sutras, or the <i>Kâshikâ-Vritti</i>,
or the <i>Phani-<!--'Volume 6 Page 339'-->Bhâshya</i>,
please send a copy of each. ... Now, just tell your Bengalis to send me
a copy of the <i>Vâchaspatya</i> Dictionary, and that will
be a good test for those tall-talking people. In England, religious
movements make very slow progress. These people here are either bigots
or atheists. And the former again have only a bit of formal religion.
They say, ""Patriotism is our religion."" That is all. </p>
<p>Send the books to America, c/o Miss Mary Phillips, 19 West
38th Street, New York, U.S.A. That is my American address. By the end
of November I shall go to America. So send my books etc., there. If
Sharat has started immediately on your receipt of my letter, then only
I may meet him, otherwise not. Business is business, no child's play.
Mr. Sturdy will see to him and accommodate him. This time I have come
to England just to probe a little. Next summer I shall try to make some
stir. The winter after that, I shall go to India. . . . Correspond
regularly with those who are interested in us, so as to keep up their
interest. Try to open centres in places all over Bengal.... This much
for the present. In my next I shall give you more details. Mr. Sturdy
is a very nice gentleman, a staunch Vedantist, and understands a
smattering of Sanskrit. It is with a good deal of labour that you can
do a little bit of work in these countries; a sheer uphill task, with
cold and rain into the bargain. Moreover, here you must support
yourself and do your labour of love. Englishmen won't spend a penny on
lectures or things of that sort. If they do come to listen to you,
well, thank your stars &#8212; as is the case in our country. Besides, the
common people here do not even know of me now. In addition to all this,
they will give you a wide berth if you preach God and such things to
them. They think this must be another clergyman! Well, you just
patiently do one thing &#8212; set about collecting everything that books,
beginning with<!--'Volume 6 Page 340'--> the Rig-Veda down
to the most insignificant of Puranas and Tantras, have got to say about
creation and annihilation of the universe, about race, heaven, and
hell, the soul, consciousness, and intellect, etc., the sense-organs,
Mukti, transmigration, and suchlike things. No child's play would do, I
want real scholarly work. The most important thing is to collect the
materials. My love to you all.&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>. . . Your suggestion to me to go back to India is no doubt
right, but a seed has been sown in this country, and there is the
possibility of its being nipped in the bud if I go away all on a
sudden. Hence I have to wait some time. Moreover it will be possible to
manage everything nicely from here. Everybody requests me to return to
India. It is all right, but don't you see it is not wise to depend upon

. . . Your suggestion to me to go back to India is no doubt right, but a seed has been sown in this country, and there is the possibility of its being nipped in the bud if I go away all on a sudden. Hence I have to wait some time. Moreover it will be possible to manage everything nicely from here. Everybody requests me to return to India. It is all right, but don't you see it is not wise to depend upon others. A wise man should stand firm on his own legs and act. Everything will come about slowly. For the present don't forget to be on the look-out for a site. We want a big plot — of about ten to twenty thousand rupees — it must be right on the Ganga.

at me in the streets. Sometimes I wonder whether my face has turned
white, but the mirror tells the truth. Yet they are all so friendly
here. </p>

than the Hindus themselves. I am getting plenty of vegetables cooked,

perfectly. When an Englishman takes up a thing, he goes to its very
depths. Yesterday I met a Prof. Fraser, a high official here. He has
been half his life in India; and he has lived so much in ancient
thought and wisdom that he does not care a fig for anything out of
India!! You will be astonished to hear that many of the thoughtful
English men and women think that the Hindu caste is the only solution
of the social problem. With that idea in their head you may imagine how
they hate the socialists and other social democrats!! Again, here the

HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING, <br>
<i>4th October, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>You know that I am now in England. I shall stay here for about
a month and go back to America. Next summer I shall again come to
England. At present there is not much prospect in England, but the Lord
is omnipotent. Let us wait and see. . . . </p>
<p>It is impossible for &#8212; to come now. The thing is, the money
belongs to Mr. Sturdy, and we must have the kind of man he likes. Mr.
Sturdy has taken initiation from me, and is a very enterprising and
good man. </p>
<p>In the first place we want a man who has a thorough mastery of
English and Sanskrit. It is true that will be able to pick up English
soon should he come here but I am as yet unable to bring men here to
learn. We want them, first, who will be able to teach. In the second
place, I trust those that will not desert me in prosperity and
adversity alike. . . . The most trustworthy men are needed. Then, after
the foundation is laid, let him who will, come and make a noise, there
is no fear. &#8212; gave no proof of wisdom in being carried away by a hubbub
and joining the party of those charlatans. Sir, granted that
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a sham, granted that it has been a very
serious mistake, indeed, to take refuge in him, but what is the way out
now? What if one life is spent in vain, but shall a <i>man</i>
eat his own words? Can there be such a thing as having a dozen
husbands? Any of you may join any party you like, I have no objection,
no, not in the least, but travelling this world over I find that save
and except his circle alone, everywhere else thought and act are at
variance. For those that belong to him, I have the utmost love, the
utmost confidence. I have no<!--'Volume 6 Page 346'-->
alternative in the matter. Call me one-sided if you will, but there you
have my <i>bona fide</i> avowal. If but a thorn pricks the
foot of one who has surrendered himself to Shri Ramakrishna, it makes
my bones ache. All others I love; you will find very few men so
unsectarian as I am; but you must excuse me, I have that bit of
bigotry. If I do not appeal to his name, whose else shall I? It will be
time enough to seek for a big Guru in our next birth; but in this, it
is that unlearned Brahmin who has bought this body of mine for ever. </p>
<p>I give you a bit of my mind; don't be angry, pray. I am your
slave so long as you are his &#8212; step a hair's breadth outside that, and
you and I are on a par. All the sects and societies that you see, the
whole host of them, inside the country or out, he has already swallowed
them all, my brother. <span lang=""sa"">""&#2350;&#2351;&#2376;&#2357;&#2376;&#2340;&#2375; &#2344;&#2367;&#2361;&#2340;&#2366;&#2307;

You know that I am now in England. I shall stay here for about a month and go back to America. Next summer I shall again come to England. At present there is not much prospect in England, but the Lord is omnipotent. Let us wait and see. . . .

It is impossible for — to come now. The thing is, the money belongs to Mr. Sturdy, and we must have the kind of man he likes. Mr. Sturdy has taken initiation from me, and is a very enterprising and good man.

In the first place we want a man who has a thorough mastery of English and Sanskrit. It is true that will be able to pick up English soon should he come here but I am as yet unable to bring men here to learn. We want them, first, who will be able to teach. In the second place, I trust those that will not desert me in prosperity and adversity alike. . . . The most trustworthy men are needed. Then, after the foundation is laid, let him who will, come and make a noise, there is no fear. — gave no proof of wisdom in being carried away by a hubbub and joining the party of those charlatans. Sir, granted that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a sham, granted that it has been a very serious mistake, indeed, to take refuge in him, but what is the way out now? What if one life is spent in vain, but shall amaneat his own words? Can there be such a thing as having a dozen husbands? Any of you may join any party you like, I have no objection, no, not in the least, but travelling this world over I find that save and except his circle alone, everywhere else thought and act are at variance. For those that belong to him, I have the utmost love, the utmost confidence. I have noalternative in the matter. Call me one-sided if you will, but there you have mybona fideavowal. If but a thorn pricks the foot of one who has surrendered himself to Shri Ramakrishna, it makes my bones ache. All others I love; you will find very few men so unsectarian as I am; but you must excuse me, I have that bit of bigotry. If I do not appeal to his name, whose else shall I? It will be time enough to seek for a big Guru in our next birth; but in this, it is that unlearned Brahmin who has bought this body of mine for ever.

I give you a bit of my mind; don't be angry, pray. I am your slave so long as you are his — step a hair's breadth outside that, and you and I are on a par. All the sects and societies that you see, the whole host of them, inside the country or out, he has already swallowed them all, my brother.""मयैवैते निहताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्रं भव सव्यसाचिन्— These have verily been killed by Myself long ago, be only the instrument, O Arjuna."" Today or tomorrow they will be merged in your own body. O man of little faith! Through his grace,""ब्रह्माण्डं गोष्पदायते— The whole universe becomes a hoof-mark of the cow.""

Name, fame, good deeds,""यज्जुहोषि यत्तपस्यसि यदश्नासिetc. — Whatever sacrifices you perform, whatever penances you undergo, whatever you eat"" — surrender everything to his feet.

<p>MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA, </p>
<p>I am very glad to receive your letter. It is excellent work
that you are doing. R&#8212; is very liberal and openhanded, but no advantage
should be taken over him for that reason. About the raising of funds by
Shrimân &#8212;, well, it is a fair enterprise; but my boy, this is a very
queer world, where even the World-Gods Brahmâ and Vishnu find it
difficult to evade the clutches of lust and gold. Wherever there is any
the least concern with money, there is the chance for misunderstanding.
Let therefore nobody undertake such work as raising money on behalf of
the Math. ... Whenever you hear of any householder collecting funds in
my or our name on the plea of erecting a Math, or some such thing, the
first thing you should do is to distrust him, and never set your hand
to it. The more so, as householders of poor means take to various
tricks to supply their wants. Therefore, if ever a trusty devotee or a
householder with a heart,<!--'Volume 6 Page 349'--> being
of affluent circumstances, undertakes such works as the founding of a
Math, or if the funds raised be kept in the custody of a trusty
householder of wealth &#8212; well and good, otherwise never have a hand in
it. On the contrary, you must dissuade others from such a thing. You
are but a boy and are ignorant of the snare of gold. Opportunities will
turn even a staunch moralist into a cheat. This is the way of the
world. </p>
<p>It is not at all in our nature to do a work conjointly. It is
to this that our miserable condition is due. He who knows how to obey
knows how to command. Learn obedience first. Among these Western
nations, with such a high spirit of independence, the spirit of
obedience is equally strong. We are all of us self-important &#8212; which
never produces any work. Great enterprise, boundless courage,
tremendous energy, and, above all, perfect obedience &#8212; these are the
only traits that lead to individual and national regeneration. These
traits are altogether lacking in us. </p>
<p>Go on with the work as you are doing it, but then you must pay
particular attention to study. J&#8212; Babu has sent a Hindi magazine, in
which Pundit R&#8212; of Alwar has published a translation of my Chicago
Address. Please convey my special indebtedness and thanks to both. </p>
<p>Let me now address myself to you &#8212; take particular care to
start a centre in Rajputana. It must be in some central place like
Jaipur or Ajmer. Then branches must be established in towns like Alwar
and Khetri. You must mix with all, we do not want to quarrel with any.
Give my loving embrace to Pundit N&#8212;; the man is very energetic, and
will be a very practical man in time. Tender my loving regards to Mr.
M&#8212; and &#8212;ji too. A Religious Association or something of the kind has
been afoot at Ajmer &#8212; what is it? Let me know all about it. M&#8212; Babu
writes that he and others have written me letters; but I have not
received any up till now. . . .<!--'Volume 6 Page 350'-->
About Maths, or centres, or anything of the kind, it is no use starting
them in Calcutta; Varanasi is the place for them. I have many plans
like that, but all depends on funds. You will know of them by degrees.
You might have noticed from the papers that our movement is steadily
gaining ground in England. Every enterprise in this country takes some
time to have a go. But once John Bull sets his hand to a thing, he will
never let it go. The Americans are quick, but they are somewhat like
straw on fire, ready to be extinguished. Do not preach to the public
that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was an Incarnation, and things of that
sort. I have some followers at &#8212; look after them. . . . Infinite power
will come unto you &#8212; never fear. Be pure, have faith, be obedient. </p>
<p>Teach against the marriage of boys. No scripture ever
sanctions it. But for the present say nothing against little girls
being married. Directly you stop the marriage of boys, that of girls
will stop of itself. Girls surely are not going to marry among
themselves! Write to the Secretary, Arya Samaj, Lahore, asking the
whereabouts of a Sannyasin named Achyutananda who used to live with
them. Make special inquiry of the man. . . . Never fear.&nbsp; </p>

<i>Thursday morning, Dec. 5, 1895.</i></p>
<p>DEAR ALBERTA, </p>
<p>Received your nice letter last evening. Very kind of you to
remember me. I am going soon to see the ""Heavenly Pair"". Mr. Leggett is
a saint as I have told you already, and your mother is a born empress,
every inch of her, with a saint's heart inside. </p>
<p>I am so glad you are enjoying the Alps so much They must be
wonderful. It is always in such places that the human soul aspires for
freedom. Even if the nation is spiritually poor, it aspires for
physical freedom. I met a young Swiss in London. He used to come to my
classes. I was very successful in London, and though I did not care for
the noisy city, I was very much pleased with the people. In your
country, Alberta, the Vedantic thought was introduced in the beginning
by ignorant ""cranks"", and one has to work his way through the
difficulties created by such introductions. You may have noticed that
only a few men or women of the upper classes ever joined my classes in
America. Again in America the upper classes being the rich, their whole
time is spent in enjoying their wealth and imitating (aping?) the
Europeans. On the other hand in England the Vedantic ideas have been
introduced by the most learned men in the country, and there are a
large number among the upper classes in England who are very
thoughtful. So you will be astonished to hear that I found my grounds
all prepared, and I am convinced that my work will have more hold on
England than America. Add to this the tremendous tenacity of the
English character, and judge for yourself. By this you will find that I
have changed a good deal of my opinion about England, and I am glad to
confess it. I am perfectly sure that we will<!--'Volume 6 Page 352'-->
do still better in Germany. I am coming back to England next summer. In
the meanwhile my work is in very able hands. Joe Joe has been the same
kind good pure friend to me here as in America, and my debt to your
family is simply immense. My love and blessings to Hollister and you.
The steamer is standing at anchor on account of fog. The purser has
very kindly given me a whole cabin by myself. Every Hindu is a Raja,
they think, and are very polite &#8212; and the charm will break, of course,

</body></html>",3424,"DEAR ALBERTA,

Received your nice letter last evening. Very kind of you to remember me. I am going soon to see the ""Heavenly Pair"". Mr. Leggett is a saint as I have told you already, and your mother is a born empress, every inch of her, with a saint's heart inside.

I am so glad you are enjoying the Alps so much They must be wonderful. It is always in such places that the human soul aspires for freedom. Even if the nation is spiritually poor, it aspires for physical freedom. I met a young Swiss in London. He used to come to my classes. I was very successful in London, and though I did not care for the noisy city, I was very much pleased with the people. In your country, Alberta, the Vedantic thought was introduced in the beginning by ignorant ""cranks"", and one has to work his way through the difficulties created by such introductions. You may have noticed that only a few men or women of the upper classes ever joined my classes in America. Again in America the upper classes being the rich, their whole time is spent in enjoying their wealth and imitating (aping?) the Europeans. On the other hand in England the Vedantic ideas have been introduced by the most learned men in the country, and there are a large number among the upper classes in England who are very thoughtful. So you will be astonished to hear that I found my grounds all prepared, and I am convinced that my work will have more hold on England than America. Add to this the tremendous tenacity of the English character, and judge for yourself. By this you will find that I have changed a good deal of my opinion about England, and I am glad to confess it. I am perfectly sure that we willdo still better in Germany. I am coming back to England next summer. In the meanwhile my work is in very able hands. Joe Joe has been the same kind good pure friend to me here as in America, and my debt to your family is simply immense. My love and blessings to Hollister and you. The steamer is standing at anchor on account of fog. The purser has very kindly given me a whole cabin by myself. Every Hindu is a Raja, they think, and are very polite — and the charm will break, of course, when they find that the Raja is penniless!!","Yours with love and blessings,

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind note of welcome. I arrived last
Friday after ten days of a very tedious voyage. It was awfully rough
and for the first time in my life I was very badly seasick. . . . I
have left some strong friends in England who will work in my absence
expecting my arrival next summer. My plans are not settled yet about
the work here. Only I have an idea to run to Detroit and Chicago
meanwhile, and then come back to New York. The public lecture plan I
intend to give up entirely, as I find the best thing for me to do is to
step entirely out of the money question &#8212; either in public lectures or
private classes. In the long run it does harm and sets a bad example. </p>
<p>In England I worked on this principle and refused even the
voluntary collections they made. Mr. Sturdy, being a rich man, bore the
major part of the expenses of lecturing in big halls &#8212; the rest I bore.
It worked well.<!--'Volume 6 Page 353'--> Again, to use
rather a vulgar illustration, even in religion there is no use
overstocking the market. The supply must follow the demand, and the
demand alone. If people want me, they will get up lectures. I need not
bother myself about these things. If you think after consultation with
Mrs. Adams and Miss Locke that it would be practicable for me to come
to Chicago for a course of lectures, write to me. Of course the money
question should be left entirely out. </p>
<p>My idea is for autonomic, independent groups in different
places. Let them work on their own account and do the best they can. As
for myself, I do not want to entangle myself in any organisation.

mentally,&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR SISTER, (Miss S. Farmer) </p>
<p>In this universe where nothing is lost, where we live in the
midst of death <i>in life</i>, every thought that is
thought, in public or in private, in crowded thoroughfares or in the
deep recesses of primeval forests, lives. They are continuously trying
to become self-embodied, and until they have embodied themselves, they
will struggle for expression, and any amount of repression cannot kill
them. Nothing can be destroyed &#8212; those thoughts that caused evil in the
past are also seeking embodiment, to be filtered through repeated
expression and, at last, transfigured into perfect good. </p>
<p>As such, there is a mass of thought which is at the present
time struggling to get expression. This new thought is telling us to
give up our dreams of dualism, of good and evil in essence, and the
still wilder dream of suppression. It teaches us that higher direction
and not destruction is the law. It teaches us that it is not a world of
bad and good, but good and better &#8212; and still better. It stops short of
nothing but acceptance. It teaches that no situation is hopeless, and
as such accepts every form of mental, moral, or spiritual thought where
it already stands, and without a word of condemnation tells it that so
far it has done good, now is the time to do better. What in old times
was thought of as the elimination of bad, it teaches as the
transfiguration of evil and the doing of better. It, above all, teaches
that the kingdom of heaven is already in existence if we will have it,
that perfection is already in man if he will see it. </p>
<p>The Greenacre meetings last summer were so wonderful,<!--'Volume 6 Page 355'-->
simply because you opened yourself fully to that thought which has
found in you so competent a medium of expression, and because you took
your stand on the highest teaching of this thought that the kingdom of
heaven already exists. </p>
<p>You have been consecrated and chosen by the Lord as a channel
for converting this thought into life, and every one that helps you in
this wonderful work is serving the Lord. </p>
<p>Our scripture teaches that he who serves the servants of the
Lord is His highest worshipper. You are a servant of the Lord, and as a

to render you any service in the carrying out of your inspired mission
wherever I be.&nbsp; </p>

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>Your letter to Sturdy has been sent over to me. It was very
kind of you to write that note. This year, I am afraid, I am getting
overworked, as I feel the strain. I want a rest badly. So it is very
good, as you say, that<!--'Volume 6 Page 358'--> the
Boston work be taken up in the end of March. By the end of April I will
start for England. </p>
<p>Land can be had in large plots in the Catskills for very
little money. There is a plot of 101 acres for $200. The money I have
ready, only I cannot buy the land in my name. You are the only friend
in this country in whom I have perfect trust. If you consent, I will
buy the land in your name. The students will go there in summer and
build cottages or camps as they like and practice meditation. Later on,
if they can collect funds, they may build something up. I am sorry, you
cannot come just now. Tomorrow will be the last Sunday lecture of this
month. The first Sunday of next month there will be a lecture in
Brooklyn; the rest, three in New York, with which I will close this
year's New York lectures. </p>
<p>I have worked my best. If there is any seed of truth in it, it
will come to life. So I have no anxiety about anything. I am also
getting tired of lecturing and having classes. After a few months' work
in England I will go to India and hide myself absolutely for some years
or for ever. I am satisfied in my conscience that I did not remain an

<p>DEAR SARADA, </p>
<p>Your letter informed me of everything; but I note that you do
not so much as refer to the cable I sent about the celebration. The
dictionary that Shashi sent a few months ago has not arrived so far.
... I am going to England soon. Sharat need not come now at all; for I
am myself going to England. I do not want people who take such a long
time to make up their minds. I did not invite him for a European tour,
and I do not have the money either. So ask him not to come, and none
else need. </p>
<p>On perusal of your letter on Tibet, I came to lose all regard
for your common sense. In the first place, it is nonsense to say that
Notovitch's book is genuine. Did you see any original copy, or bring it
to India? Secondly, you say you saw in the Kailas Math the portrait<!--'Volume 6 Page 360'-->
of Jesus and the Samaritan Woman. How do you know that it was Jesus'
portrait, and not that of a man in the street? Even taking it for
granted, how do you know that it was not put up in the said Math by
someone who was a Christian? And your opinions on the Tibetans too are
unsound; you did not certainly see the heart of Tibet, but only a
fringe of the trade route. In places like those only the dregs of a
nation are to be met. If on seeing the Chinabazar and Barabazar
quarters of Calcutta, anybody called every Bengali a liar, would that
be correct? </p>
<p>Consult Shashi properly when writing any article. ... What you
need is only obedience. ...&nbsp; </p>

Müller. He is a saintly man and looks like a young man in spite of his
seventy years, and his face is without a wrinkle. I wish I had half his
love for India and Vedanta. At the same time he is a friend of Yoga too
and believes in it. Only he has no patience with humbugs. </p>

. . . Day before yesterday I had a fine visit with Prof. Max Müller. He is a saintly man and looks like a young man in spite of his seventy years, and his face is without a wrinkle. I wish I had half his love for India and Vedanta. At the same time he is a friend of Yoga too and believes in it. Only he has no patience with humbugs.

Above all, his reverence for Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is extreme, and he has written an article on him for theNineteenth Century. He asked me, ""What are youdoing to make him known to the world?"" Ramakrishna has charmed him for years. Is it not good news? . . .

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>The <i>Raja-Yoga</i> book is going on splendidly.
Saradananda goes to the States soon. </p>
<p>I do not like any one whom I love to become a lawyer, although
my father was one. My Master was against it, and I believe that that
family is sure to come to grief where there are several lawyers. Our
country is full of them; the universities turn them out by the
hundreds. What my nation wants is pluck and scientific genius. So I
want Mohin to be an electrician. Even if he fails in life, still I will
have the satisfaction that he strove to become great and really useful
to his country. ... In <i>America alone</i> there is that
something in the air which brings out whatever is best in every one.
... I want him to be daring, bold, and to struggle to cut a new path
for himself and his nation. An electrical engineer can make a living in
India.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours with love, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>

<i>6th July, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRANKINCENSE, (Mr. Francis H. Leggett whom Swamiji
addressed thus.) </p>
<p>. . . Things are going on with me very well on this side of
the Atlantic. </p>
<p>The Sunday lectures were quite successful; so were the
classes. The season has ended and I too am thoroughly exhausted. I am
going to make a tour in Switzerland with Miss Müller. The Galsworthys
have been very very kind. Joe (Miss Josephine MacLeod, also referred to
as Joe Joe.) brought them round splendidly. I simply admire Joe in her
tact and quiet way. She is a feminine statesman or woman. She can wield
a kingdom. I have seldom seen such strong yet good common sense in a
human being. I will return next autumn and take up the work in America.
</p>
<p>The night before last I was at a party at Mrs. Martin's, about
whom you must already know a good deal from Joe. </p>
<p>Well, the work is growing silently yet surely in England.
Almost every other man or woman came to me and talked about the work.
This British Empire with all its drawbacks is the greatest machine that
ever existed for the dissemination of ideas. I mean to put my ideas<!--'Volume 6 Page 366'-->
in the centre of this machine, and they will spread all over the world.
Of course, all great work is slow, and the difficulties are too many,
especially as we Hindus are the conquered race. Yet, that is the very
reason why it is bound to work, for spiritual ideals have always come
from the downtrodden. Jews overwhelmed the Roman Empire with their
spiritual ideals. You will be pleased to know that I am also learning
my lessons every day in patience and, above all, in sympathy. I think I
am beginning to see the Divine, even inside the high and mighty
Anglo-Indians. I think I am slowly approaching to that state when I
should be able to love the very ""Devil"" himself, if there were any. </p>
<p>At twenty years of age I was the most unsympathetic,
uncompromising fanatic; I would not walk on the footpath on the theatre
side of the streets in Calcutta. At thirty-three, I can live in the
same house with prostitutes and never would think of saying a word of
reproach to them. Is it degenerate? Or is it that I am broadening out
into the Universal Love which is the Lord Himself? Again I have heard
that if one does not sea the evil round him he cannot do good work &#8212; he
lapses into a sort of fatalism. I do not see that. On the other hand,
my power of work is immensely increasing and becoming immensely
effective. Some days I get into a sort of ecstasy. I feel that I must
bless every one, everything, love and embrace everything, and I do see
that evil is a delusion. I am in one of these moods now, dear Francis,
and am actually shedding tears of joy at the thought of you and Mrs.
Leggett's love and kindness to me. I bless the day I was born. I have
had so much of kindness and love here, and that Love Infinite that
brought me into being has guarded every one of my actions, good or bad,
(don't be frightened), for what am I, what was I ever, but a tool in
His hands, for whose service I have given up everything, my beloved
ones, my<!--'Volume 6 Page 367'--> joys, my life? He is my
playful darling, I am His playfellow. There is neither rhyme nor reason
in the universe! That reason binds Him? He the playful one is playing
these tears and laughters over all parts of the play! Great fun, great
fun, as Joe says. </p>
<p>It is a funny world, and the funniest chap you ever saw is He
&#8212; the Beloved Infinite! Fun, is it not? Brotherhood or playmatehood &#8212; a
school of romping children let out to play in this playground of the
world! Isn't it? Whom to praise, whom to blame, it is all His play.
They want explanations, but how can you explain Him? He is brainless,
nor has He any reason. He is fooling us with little brains and reason,
but this time He won't find me napping. </p>
<p>I have learnt a thing or two: Beyond, beyond reason and
learning and talking is the feeling, the ""Love"", the ""Beloved"". Ay, <i>saké</i>,
fill up the cup and we will be mad.</p>

<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>Today I received a letter from Ramdayal Babu, in which he
writes that many public women attend the Ramakrishna anniversary
festival at Dakshineswar, which makes many less inclined to go there.
Moreover, in his opinion one day should be appointed for men and
another for women. My decision on the point is this: </p>
<p>1. If public women are not allowed to go to such a great place
of pilgrimage as Dakshineswar, where else shall they go to? It is for
the sinful that the Lord manifests Himself specially, not so much for
the virtuous. </p>
<p>2. Let distinctions of sex, caste, wealth, learning, and the
whole host of them, which are so many gateways to hell, be confined to
the world alone. If such distinctions persist in holy places of
pilgrimage, where then lies the difference between them and hell
itself? </p>
<p>3. Ours is a gigantic City of Jagannâtha, where those who have
sinned and those who have not, the saintly and the vicious, men and
women and children irrespective of age, all have equal right. That for
one day at least in the year thousand of men and women get rid of the
sense of sin and ideas of distinction and sing and hear the name of the
Lord, is in itself a supreme good. </p>
<p>4. If even in a place of pilgrimage people's tendency to evil
be not curbed for one day, the fault lies with you, not them. Create
such a huge tidal wave of spirituality that whatever people come near
will be swept away. </p>
<p>5. Those who, even in a chapel, would think this is a public
woman, that man is of a low caste, a third is poor, and yet another
belongs to the masses &#8212; the less be the number of such people (that is,
whom you call gentlemen) the better. Will they who look to the caste,
sex, or profession of Bhaktas appreciate our Lord? I pray<!--'Volume 6 Page 370'-->
to the Lord that hundreds of public women may come and bow their heads
at His feet; it does not matter if not one gentleman comes. Come public
women, come drunkards, come thieves and all &#8212; His Gate is open to all.

conduct, they will at once expel them from the garden. But so long as
they behave like good men and women, they are Bhaktas and are to be
respected &#8212; be they men or women, honest citizens or unchaste. </p>

<i>23rd August, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. BULL,</p>
<p>I received your last today. By this time you must have
received my receipt for £5 you sent. I do not know what membership you
mean. I have no objection to have my name to be put on the list of
membership of any society. As for Sturdy, I do not know what his
opinions are. I am now travelling in Switzerland; from hence I<!--'Volume 6 Page 371'-->
go to Germany, then to England, and next winter to India. I am very
glad to hear that Saradananda and Goodwin are doing good work in the
U.S. As for me, I do not lay any claim to that £500 for any work. I
think I have worked enough. I am now going to retire. I have sent for
another man from India who will join me next month. <a name=""from_east_west""></a>I have begun the
work, let others work it out. So you see, to set the work going I had
to touch money and property, for a time. Now I am sure my part of the
work is done, and I have no more interest in Vedanta or any philosophy
in the world or the work itself. I am getting ready to depart to return
no more to this hell, this world. Even its religious utility is
beginning to pall me. May Mother gather me soon to Herself never to
come back any more! These works, and doing good, etc., are just a
little exercise to cleanse the mind. I had enough of it. This world
will be world ever and always. What we are, so we see it. Who works?
Whose work? There is no world. It is God Himself. In delusion we call
it world. Neither I nor thou nor you &#8212; it is all He the Lord, all One.
So I do not want anything to do about money matters from this time. It
is your money. You spend what comes to you just as you like, and
blessings follow you.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours in the Lord, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p><br>
PS. I have entire sympathy with the work of Dr. Janes and have written
him so. If Goodwin and Saradananda can speed the work in U.S., Godspeed
to them. They are in no way bound to me or to Sturdy or to anybody
else. It was an awful mistake in the Greenacre programme that it was
printed that Saradananda was there by the kind permission (leave of
absence from England) of Sturdy. Who is Sturdy or anybody else to <i>permit</i>
a Sannyasin? Sturdy himself laughed at it and was sorry too. It was a
piece of folly. Nothing short of<!--'Volume 6 Page 372'-->
that. It was an insult to Sturdy and would have proved serious for my
work if it had reached India. Fortunately I tore all those notices to
pieces and threw them into the gutter, and wondered whether it was the
celebrated ""Yankee"" manners the English people delight in talking
about. Even so, I am no master to any Sannyasin in this world. They do
whatever it suits them, and if I can help them &#8212; that is all my
connection with them. I have given up the bondage of iron, the family
tie &#8212; I am not to take up the golden chain of religious brotherhood. I
am free, must always be free. I wish everyone to be free &#8212; free as the
air. If New York needs Vedanta, or Boston, or any other place in the
U.S., it must receive them and keep them and provide for them. As for
me, I am as good as retired. I have played my part in the world.</p>

<p>DEAR SISTER, (Miss Harriet Hale.) </p>
<p>Your very welcome news reached me just now, on my return here
from Switzerland. I am very, very happy to learn that at last you have
thought it better to change your mind about the felicity of ""Old Maids
Home"". You are perfectly right now &#8212; marriage is the truest goal for
ninety-nine per cent of the human race, and they will live the happiest
life as soon as they have learnt and are ready to abide by the eternal
lesson &#8212; that we are bound to bear and forbear and that life to every
one must be a compromise. </p>
<p>Believe me, dear Harriet, perfect life is a contradiction in
terms. Therefore we must always expect to find things not up to our
highest ideal. Knowing this, we are bound to make the best of
everything. From what I know of<!--'Volume 6 Page 373'-->
you, you have the calm power which bears and forbears to a great
degree, and therefore I am safe to prophesy that your married life will
be very happy. </p>
<p>All blessings attend you and your <i>fiancé</i>
and may the Lord make him always remember what good fortune was his in
getting such a wife as you &#8212; good, intelligent, loving, and beautiful.
I am afraid it is impossible for me to cross the Atlantic so soon. I
wish I could, to see your marriage. </p>
<p>The best I can do in the circumstances is to quote from one of
our books: ""May you always enjoy the undivided love of your husband,
helping him in attaining all that is desirable in this life, and when
you have seen your children's children, and the drama of life is
nearing its end, may you help each other in reaching that infinite

<p class=""right"">C/O MISS MULLER, <br>
AIRLIE LODGE, RIDGEWAY GARDENS, <br>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, <br>
<i>7th October, 1896</i>.</p>
<p> Once more in London, dear Joe Joe, and the classes have begun
already. Instinctively I looked about for one familiar face which never
had a line of discouragement, never changed, but was always helpful,
cheerful, and<!--'Volume 6 Page 374'--> strengthening &#8212;
and my mind conjured up that face before me, in spite of a few thousand
miles of space. For what is space in the realm of spirit? Well, you are
gone to your home of rest and peace. For me, ever-increasing mad work;
yet I have your blessings with me always, have I not? My natural
tendency is to go into a cave and be quiet, but a fate behind pushes me
forward and I go. Whoever could resist fate? </p>
<p>Why did not Christ say in the Sermon on the Mount, ""Blessed
are they that are always cheerful and always hopeful for they have
already the kingdom of heaven""? I am sure, He must have said it, He
with the sorrows of a whole world in His heart, He who likened the
saintly soul with the child &#8212; but it was not noted down; of a thousand
things they noted down only one, I mean, remembered. </p>
<p>Most of our friends came &#8212; one of the Galsworthys too &#8212; i.e.
the married daughter. Mrs. Galsworthy could not come today; it was very
short notice. We have a hall now, a pretty big one holding about 200 or
more. There is a big corner which will be fitted up as the Library. I
have another man from India now to help me. </p>
<p>I enjoyed Switzerland immensely, also Germany. Prof. Deussen
was very kind &#8212; we came together to London and had great <i>fun</i>
here. Prof. Max Müller is very, very friendly too. In all, the English
work is becoming solid &#8212; and respectable too, seeing that great
scholars are sympathising. Probably I go to India this winter with some
English friends. So far about my own sweet self. </p>
<p>Now what about the holy family? Everything is going on
first-rate, I am sure. You must have heard of Fox by this time. I am
afraid I rather made him dejected the day before he sailed by telling
him that he could not marry Mabel, until he began to earn a good deal
of money! Is Mabel with you now? Give her my love. Also give me your
present address. </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 375'-->
<p>How is Mother? Frankincense, same solid sterling gold as ever,
I am sure. Alberta, working at her music and languages, laughing a good
deal and eating a good many apples as usual? By the by, I now live
mostly on fruits and nuts. They seem to agree with me well. If ever the
old doctor, with ""land"" up somewhere, comes to see you, you may confide
to him this secret. I have lost a good deal of my fat. But on days I
lecture, I have to go on solid food. How is Hollis? I never saw a
sweeter boy &#8212; may all blessings ever attend him through life. </p>
<p>I hear your friend Cola is lecturing on Zoroastrian philosophy
&#8212; surely the stars are not smiling on him. What about your Miss Andreas
and our Yogananda? What news about the brotherhood of the ZZZ's and our
Mrs. (forgotten!)? I hear that half a shipload of Hindus and Buddhists
and Mohammedans and Brotherhoods and what not have entered the U.S.,
and another cargo of Mahatma-seekers, evangelists etc. have entered
India! Good. India and the U.S. seem to be two countries for religious
enterprise. Have a care, Joe; the heathen corruption is dreadful. I met
Madam Sterling in the street today. She does not come any more for my
lectures, good for her. Too much of philosophy is not good. Do you
remember that lady who used to come to every meeting too late to hear a
word but button-holed me immediately after and kept me talking, till a
battle of Waterloo would be raging in my internal economy through
hunger? She came. They are all coming and more. That is cheering. </p>
<p>It is getting late in the night. So goodnight, Joe. (Is strict
etiquette to be followed in New York too?) And Lord bless you ever and
ever. </p>
<p>""Man's all-wise maker, wishing to create a faultless form
whose matchless symmetry should far transcend creation's choicest
works, did call together by his mighty will, and garner up in his
eternal mind, a bright assemblage of all lovely things, and then, as in
a picture,<!--'Volume 6 Page 376'--> fashioned them into
one perfect and ideal form. Such the divine, the wondrous prototype
whence her fair shape was moulded into being."" (<i>Shakuntalam</i>
by Kalidasa, translated by Monier Williams). </p>
<p>That is you, Joe Joe; only I would add, the same the creator
did with all purity and nobility and other qualities and then Joe was
made.</p>
<p class=""right"">Ever yours, with love and blessings, </p>

<h2>CXII</h2>
<p class=""right"">14 GREYCOAT GARDENS, WESTMINSTER, <br>
LONDON, ENGLAND, <br>
<i>1st November, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARY, (Miss Mary Hale.) </p>
<p>""Silver and gold"", my dear Mary, ""have I none; but such as I
have give I thee"" freely, and that is the knowledge that the goldness
of gold, the silverness of silver, the manhood of man, the womanhood of
woman, the reality of everything is the Lord &#8212; and that this Lord we
are trying to realise from time without beginning in the objective, and
in the attempt throwing up such ""queer"" creatures of our fancy as man,
woman, child, body, mind, the earth, sun, moon, stars, the world, love,
hate, property, wealth, etc.; also ghosts, devils, angels and gods, God
etc. </p>
<p>The fact being that the Lord is in us, we are He, the eternal
subject, the real ego, never to be objectified, and that all this
objectifying process is mere waste of time and talent. When the soul
becomes aware of this, it gives up objectifying and falls back more and
more upon the subjective. This is the evolution, less and less in the
body and more and more in the mind &#8212; <i>man</i> the
highest form, meaning in Sanskrit <i>manas</i>, thought &#8212;
the animal that thinks and not the animal that ""senses"" only. This is
what in theology is called ""renunciation"". The formation of society,
the institution of marriage, the love for children, our good works,
morality, and ethics are all different forms of renunciation. All our
lives in every society are the subjection of the will, the thirst, the
desire. This surrender of the will or the fictitious self &#8212; or the
desire to jump out of ourselves, as it were &#8212; the struggle still to
objectify the subject &#8212; is the one phenomenon in this world of which
all societies and social forms are various modes and stages. Love is
the easiest and smoothest<!--'Volume 6 Page 379'--> way
towards the self-surrender or subjection of the will and hatred, the
opposite. </p>
<p>People have been cajoled through various stories or
superstitions of heavens and hells and Rulers above the sky, towards
this one end of self-surrender. The philosopher does the same knowingly
without superstition, by giving up desires. </p>
<p>An objective heaven or millennium therefore has existence only
in the fancy &#8212; but a subjective one is already in existence. The
musk-deer, after vain search for the cause of the scent of the musk, at
last will have to find it in himself. </p>
<p>Objective society will always be a mixture of good and evil &#8212;
objective life will always be followed by its shadow death, and the
longer the life, the longer will also be the shadow. It is only when
the sun is on our own head that <i>there is no shadow</i>.
When God and good and everything else is in us, there is no evil. In
objective life, however, every bullet has its billet &#8212; evil goes with
every good as its shadow. Every improvement is coupled with an equal
degradation. The reason being that good and evil are not two things but
one, the difference being only in manifestation &#8212; one of degree, not
kind. </p>
<p>Our very lives depend upon the death of others &#8212; plants or
animals or bacilli! The other great mistake we often make is that good
is taken as an ever-increasing item, whilst evil is a fixed quantity.
From this it is argued that evil being diminished every day, there will
come a time when good alone will remain. The fallacy lies in the
assumption of a false premise. If good is increasing, so is evil. My
desires have been much more than the desires of the masses among my
race. My joys have been much greater than theirs &#8212; but my miseries a
million times more intense. The same constitution that makes you feel
the least touch of good makes you feel the least of evil too. The same
nerves that carry sensations of pleasure carry the<!--'Volume 6 Page 382'-->
sensations of pain too &#8212; and the same mind feels both. The progress of
the world means more enjoyment and more misery too. This mixture of
life and death, good and evil, knowledge and ignorance is what is
called Maya &#8212; or the universal phenomenon. You may go on for eternity
inside this net, seeking for happiness &#8212; you find much, and much evil
too. To have good and no evil is childish nonsense. Two ways are left
open &#8212; one by giving up all hope to take up the world as it is and bear
the pangs and pains in the hope of a crumb of happiness now and then.
The other, to give up the search for pleasure, knowing it to be pain in
another form, and seek for <i>truth</i> &#8212; and those that
dare try for truth succeed in finding that truth as ever present &#8212;
present in themselves. Then we also discover how the same truth is
manifesting itself both in our relative error and knowledge &#8212; we find
also that the same truth is bliss which again is manifesting itself as
good and evil, and with it also we find real existence which is
manifesting itself as both death and life. </p>
<p>Thus we realise that all these phenomena are but the
reflections, bifurcated or manifolded, of the one existence,
truth-bliss-unity &#8212; my real Self and the reality of everything else.
Then and then only is it possible to do good without evil, for such a
soul has known and got the control of the material of which both good
and evil are manufactured, and he alone can manifest one or the other
as he likes, and we know he manifests only good. This is the
Jivan-mukta &#8212; the living free &#8212; the goal of Vedanta as of all other
philosophies. </p>
<p>Human society is in turn governed by the four castes &#8212; the
priests, the soldiers, the traders, and the labourers. Each state has
its glories as well as its defects. When the priest (Brahmin) rules,
there is a tremendous exclusiveness on hereditary grounds; the persons
of the priests and their descendants are hemmed in with all sorts of<!--'Volume 6 Page 381'-->
safeguards &#8212; none but they have any knowledge &#8212; none but they have the
right to impart that knowledge. Its glory is that at this period is
laid the foundation of sciences. The priests cultivate the mind, for
through the mind they govern. </p>
<p>The military (Kshatriya) rule is tyrannical and cruel, but
they are not exclusive; and during that period arts and social culture
attain their height. </p>
<p>The commercial (Vaishya) rule comes next. It is awful in its
silent crushing and blood-sucking power. Its advantage is, as the
trader himself goes everywhere, he is a good disseminator of ideas
collected during the two previous states. They are still less exclusive
than the military, but culture begins to decay. </p>
<p>Last will come the labourer (Shudra) rule. Its advantages will
be the distribution of physical comforts &#8212; its disadvantages, (perhaps)
the lowering of culture. There will be a great distribution of ordinary
education, but extraordinary geniuses will be less and less. </p>
<p>If it is possible to form a state in which the knowledge of
the priest period, the culture of the military, the distributive spirit
of the commercial, and the ideal of equality of the last can all be
kept intact, minus their evils, it will be an deal state. But is it
possible? </p>
<p>Yet the first three have had their day. Now is the time for
the last &#8212; they must have it &#8212; none can resist it. I do not know all
the difficulties about the gold or silver standards (nobody seems to
know much as to that), but this much I see that the gold standard has
been making the poor poorer, and the rich richer. Bryan was right when
he said, ""We refuse to be crucified on a cross of gold."" The silver
standard will give the poor a better chance in this unequal fight. I am
a socialist not because I think it is a perfect system, but half a loaf
is better than no bread. </p>
<p>The other systems have been tried and found wanting.<!--'Volume 6 Page 382'-->

""Silver and gold"", my dear Mary, ""have I none; but such as I have give I thee"" freely, and that is the knowledge that the goldness of gold, the silverness of silver, the manhood of man, the womanhood of woman, the reality of everything is the Lord — and that this Lord we are trying to realise from time without beginning in the objective, and in the attempt throwing up such ""queer"" creatures of our fancy as man, woman, child, body, mind, the earth, sun, moon, stars, the world, love, hate, property, wealth, etc.; also ghosts, devils, angels and gods, God etc.

The fact being that the Lord is in us, we are He, the eternal subject, the real ego, never to be objectified, and that all this objectifying process is mere waste of time and talent. When the soul becomes aware of this, it gives up objectifying and falls back more and more upon the subjective. This is the evolution, less and less in the body and more and more in the mind —manthe highest form, meaning in Sanskritmanas, thought — the animal that thinks and not the animal that ""senses"" only. This is what in theology is called ""renunciation"". The formation of society, the institution of marriage, the love for children, our good works, morality, and ethics are all different forms of renunciation. All our lives in every society are the subjection of the will, the thirst, the desire. This surrender of the will or the fictitious self — or the desire to jump out of ourselves, as it were — the struggle still to objectify the subject — is the one phenomenon in this world of which all societies and social forms are various modes and stages. Love is the easiest and smoothestway towards the self-surrender or subjection of the will and hatred, the opposite.

People have been cajoled through various stories or superstitions of heavens and hells and Rulers above the sky, towards this one end of self-surrender. The philosopher does the same knowingly without superstition, by giving up desires.

An objective heaven or millennium therefore has existence only in the fancy — but a subjective one is already in existence. The musk-deer, after vain search for the cause of the scent of the musk, at last will have to find it in himself.

Objective society will always be a mixture of good and evil — objective life will always be followed by its shadow death, and the longer the life, the longer will also be the shadow. It is only when the sun is on our own head thatthere is no shadow. When God and good and everything else is in us, there is no evil. In objective life, however, every bullet has its billet — evil goes with every good as its shadow. Every improvement is coupled with an equal degradation. The reason being that good and evil are not two things but one, the difference being only in manifestation — one of degree, not kind.

Our very lives depend upon the death of others — plants or animals or bacilli! The other great mistake we often make is that good is taken as an ever-increasing item, whilst evil is a fixed quantity. From this it is argued that evil being diminished every day, there will come a time when good alone will remain. The fallacy lies in the assumption of a false premise. If good is increasing, so is evil. My desires have been much more than the desires of the masses among my race. My joys have been much greater than theirs — but my miseries a million times more intense. The same constitution that makes you feel the least touch of good makes you feel the least of evil too. The same nerves that carry sensations of pleasure carry thesensations of pain too — and the same mind feels both. The progress of the world means more enjoyment and more misery too. This mixture of life and death, good and evil, knowledge and ignorance is what is called Maya — or the universal phenomenon. You may go on for eternity inside this net, seeking for happiness — you find much, and much evil too. To have good and no evil is childish nonsense. Two ways are left open — one by giving up all hope to take up the world as it is and bear the pangs and pains in the hope of a crumb of happiness now and then. The other, to give up the search for pleasure, knowing it to be pain in another form, and seek fortruth— and those that dare try for truth succeed in finding that truth as ever present — present in themselves. Then we also discover how the same truth is manifesting itself both in our relative error and knowledge — we find also that the same truth is bliss which again is manifesting itself as good and evil, and with it also we find real existence which is manifesting itself as both death and life.

Thus we realise that all these phenomena are but the reflections, bifurcated or manifolded, of the one existence, truth-bliss-unity — my real Self and the reality of everything else. Then and then only is it possible to do good without evil, for such a soul has known and got the control of the material of which both good and evil are manufactured, and he alone can manifest one or the other as he likes, and we know he manifests only good. This is the Jivan-mukta — the living free — the goal of Vedanta as of all other philosophies.

Human society is in turn governed by the four castes — the priests, the soldiers, the traders, and the labourers. Each state has its glories as well as its defects. When the priest (Brahmin) rules, there is a tremendous exclusiveness on hereditary grounds; the persons of the priests and their descendants are hemmed in with all sorts ofsafeguards — none but they have any knowledge — none but they have the right to impart that knowledge. Its glory is that at this period is laid the foundation of sciences. The priests cultivate the mind, for through the mind they govern.

The military (Kshatriya) rule is tyrannical and cruel, but they are not exclusive; and during that period arts and social culture attain their height.

The commercial (Vaishya) rule comes next. It is awful in its silent crushing and blood-sucking power. Its advantage is, as the trader himself goes everywhere, he is a good disseminator of ideas collected during the two previous states. They are still less exclusive than the military, but culture begins to decay.

Last will come the labourer (Shudra) rule. Its advantages will be the distribution of physical comforts — its disadvantages, (perhaps) the lowering of culture. There will be a great distribution of ordinary education, but extraordinary geniuses will be less and less.

If it is possible to form a state in which the knowledge of the priest period, the culture of the military, the distributive spirit of the commercial, and the ideal of equality of the last can all be kept intact, minus their evils, it will be an deal state. But is it possible?

Yet the first three have had their day. Now is the time for the last — they must have it — none can resist it. I do not know all the difficulties about the gold or silver standards (nobody seems to know much as to that), but this much I see that the gold standard has been making the poor poorer, and the rich richer. Bryan was right when he said, ""We refuse to be crucified on a cross of gold."" The silver standard will give the poor a better chance in this unequal fight. I am a socialist not because I think it is a perfect system, but half a loaf is better than no bread.

The other systems have been tried and found wanting.Let this one be tried — if for nothing else, for the novelty of the thing. A redistribution of pain and pleasure is better than always the same persons having pains and pleasures. The sum total of good and evil in the world remains ever the same. The yoke will be lifted from shoulder to shoulder by new systems, that is all.

Let every dog have his day in this miserable world, so that after this experience of so-called happiness they may all come to the Lord and give up this vanity of a world and governments and all other botherations.

With love to you all,","Ever your faithful brother,

<p>I have three English friends with me. Two of them, Mr. and
Mrs. Sevier, are going to settle in Almora. They are my disciples, you
know, and they are going to build the Goliath for me in the Himalayas.

want a whole hill, with a view of the snow-range, all to ourselves. It
would of course take time to fix on the site and complete the building.
In the meanwhile will you kindly engage a small bungalow for my
friends? The bungalow ought to accommodate three persons. I do not
require a large one. A small one would do for the present. My friends
will live in this bungalow in Almora and then go about looking for a

departure for India. The work in London has been a roaring success. The
English are not so bright as the Americans, but once you touch their
heart, it is yours for ever. Slowly have I gained, and it is strange
that in six months' work altogether I would have a steady class of 120
persons apart from public lectures. Here every one means work &#8212; the

to India with me to work and spend their own money on it! There are
scores here ready to do the same: men and women of position, ready to
give up everything for the idea, once they feel convinced! And last
though not the least, the help in the shape of money to start my ""work""
in India has come and more will follow. My ideas about the English have
been revolutionized. I now understand why the Lord has blessed them
above all other races. They are steady, sincere to the backbone, with
great depths of feeling &#8212; only with a crust of stoicism on the surface;
if that is broken, you have your man. </p>
<p>Now I am going to start a centre in Calcutta and another in
the Himalayas. The Himalayan one will be an entire hill about 7,000 ft.
high &#8212; cool in summer, cold<!--'Volume 6 Page 385'--> in

centre for European workers, as I do not want to kill them by forcing
on them the Indian mode of living and the fiery plains. My plan is to
send out numbers of Hindu boys to every civilised country to preach &#8212;
get men and women from foreign countries to work in India. This would
be a good exchange. After having established the centres, I go about up
and down like the gentleman in the book of Job. </p>

<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>It is needless to express my gratitude at your most generous
offer. I don't want to encumber myself with a large amount of money at
the first start, but as things progress on I will be very glad to find
employment for that sum. My idea is to start on a very small scale. I
do not know anything yet. I will know my bearings when on the spot in
India. From India I will write to you more details about my plans and
the practical way to realise them. I start on the 16th and after a few
days in Italy take the steamer at Naples. </p>
<p>Kindly convey my love to Mrs. Vaughan and Saradananda and to
the rest of my friends there. As for you, I have always regarded you as
the best friend I have, and it will be the same all my life. </p>

relieve that first, as the old proverb says. So it has been employed
accordingly. </p>

has not yet arrived. </p>
<p>Also there is a letter from Dr. Janes suggesting work along
the line of your conference, here in India. It is almost impossible for
me to pay any attention to these things. I am so, so tired. I do not
know whether I would live even six months more or not, unless I have
some rest. </p>
<p>Now I have to start two centres, one in Madras, the other in
Calcutta. The Madras people are deeper and more sincere, and, I am
sure, will be able to collect funds<!--'Volume 6 Page 389'-->
from Madras itself. The Calcutta people are mostly enthusiastic (I mean
the aristocracy) through patriotism, and their sympathy would never
materialise. On the other hand, the country is full of persons, jealous

<p>I have already £500 from England about, £500 from Mr. Sturdy,
and if your money be added to it, I am sure I will be able to start the
two. I think, therefore, you ought to send the money as soon as
possible. The safest way is to put the money in a bank in America in
your and my name jointly, so that either of us may draw it. In case I
die before the money is employed, you will be able to draw it all and
put it to the use I wanted. So that, in case of my death, none of my

<h2>CXXIII</h2>
<p class=""right"">DARJEELING, <br>
<i>April 28, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>A few days ago I received your beautiful letter. Yesterday
came the card announcing Harriet's marriage. Lord bless the happy pair!
</p>
<p>The whole country here rose like one man to receive me.
Hundreds of thousands of persons, shouting and<!--'Volume 6 Page 390'-->
cheering at every place, Rajas drawing my carriage, arches all over the
streets of the capitals with blazing mottoes etc.,!!! The whole thing
will soon come out in the form of a book, and you will have a copy
soon. But unfortunately I was already exhausted by hard work in
England; and this tremendous exertion in the heat of Southern India
prostrated me completely. I had of course to give up the idea of
visiting other parts of India and fly up to the nearest hill station,
Darjeeling. Now I feel much better, and a month more in Almora would
complete the cure. By the bye, I have just lost a chance of coming over
to Europe. Raja Ajit Singh and several other Rajas start next Saturday
for England. Of course, they wanted hard to get me to go over with
them. But unfortunately the doctors would not hear of my undertaking
any physical or mental labour just now. So with the greatest chagrin I
had to give it up, reserving it for a near future. </p>
<p>Dr. Barrows has reached America by this time, I hope. Poor
man! He came here to preach the most bigoted Christianity, with the
usual result that nobody listened to him. Of course they received him
very kindly; but it was my letter that did it. I could not put brains
into him! Moreover, he seems to be a queer sort of man. I hear that he
was mad at the national rejoicings over my coming home. You ought to
have sent a brainier man anyway, for the Parliament of Religions has
been made a farce of in the Hindu mind by Dr. Barrows. On metaphysical
lines no nation on earth can hold a candle to the Hindus; and curiously
all the fellows that come over here from Christian land have that one
antiquated foolishness of an argument that because the Christians are
powerful and rich and the Hindus are not, so Christianity must be
better than Hinduism. To which the Hindus very aptly retort that, that
is the very reason why Hinduism is a religion and Christianity is not;
because,<!--'Volume 6 Page 391'--> in this beastly world
it is blackguardism and that alone which <i>prospers</i>,
virtue always suffers. It seems, however advanced the Western nations
are in scientific culture, they are mere babies in metaphysical and
spiritual education. Material science can only give worldly prosperity,
whilst spiritual science is for eternal life. If there be no eternal
life, still the enjoyment of spiritual thoughts as ideals is keener and
makes a man happier, whilst the foolery of materialism leads to
competition and undue ambition and ultimate death, individual and
national. </p>
<p>This Darjeeling is a beautiful spot with a view of the
glorious Kanchenjanga (28,146 ft.) now and then when the clouds permit
it, and from a near hilltop one can catch a glimpse of Gauri Shankar
(29,000 ft?) now and then. Then, the people here too are so
picturesque, the Tibetans and Nepalese and, above all, the beautiful
Lepcha women. Do you know one Colston Turnbull of Chicago? He was here
a few weeks before I reached India. He seems to have had a great liking
for me, with the result that Hindu people all liked him very much. What
about Joe, Mrs. Adams, Sister Josephine, and all the rest of our
friends? Where are our beloved Mills? Grinding slow but sure? I wanted
to send some nuptial presents to Harriet, but with your ""terrible""
duties I must reserve it for some near future. Maybe I shall meet them
in Europe very soon. I would have been very glad, of course, if you
could announce your engagement, and I would fulfil my promise by
filling up half a dozen papers in one letter.... </p>
<p>My hair is turning grey in bundles, and my face is getting
wrinkled up all over; that losing of flesh has given me twenty years of
age more. And now I am losing flesh rapidly, because I am made to live
upon meat and meat alone &#8212; no bread, no rice, no potatoes, not even a
lump of sugar in my coffee!! I am living with a Brahmin family<!--'Volume 6 Page 392'-->
who all dress in knickerbockers, women excepted of course! I am also in
knickers. I would have given you a surprise if you had seen me bounding
from rock to rock like a chamois, or galloping might and main up and
down mountain roads. </p>
<p>I am very well here, for life in the plains has become a
torture. I cannot put the tip of my nose out into the streets, but
there is a curious crowd!! Fame is not all milk and honey!! I am going
to train a big beard; now it is turning grey. It gives a venerable
appearance and saves one from American scandal-mongers! O thou white
hair, how much thou canst conceal, all glory unto thee, Hallelujah! </p>
<p>The mail time is nearly up, so I finish. Good dreams, good
health, all blessings attend you. </p>

</body></html>",6186,"DEAR MARY,

A few days ago I received your beautiful letter. Yesterday came the card announcing Harriet's marriage. Lord bless the happy pair!

The whole country here rose like one man to receive me. Hundreds of thousands of persons, shouting andcheering at every place, Rajas drawing my carriage, arches all over the streets of the capitals with blazing mottoes etc.,!!! The whole thing will soon come out in the form of a book, and you will have a copy soon. But unfortunately I was already exhausted by hard work in England; and this tremendous exertion in the heat of Southern India prostrated me completely. I had of course to give up the idea of visiting other parts of India and fly up to the nearest hill station, Darjeeling. Now I feel much better, and a month more in Almora would complete the cure. By the bye, I have just lost a chance of coming over to Europe. Raja Ajit Singh and several other Rajas start next Saturday for England. Of course, they wanted hard to get me to go over with them. But unfortunately the doctors would not hear of my undertaking any physical or mental labour just now. So with the greatest chagrin I had to give it up, reserving it for a near future.

Dr. Barrows has reached America by this time, I hope. Poor man! He came here to preach the most bigoted Christianity, with the usual result that nobody listened to him. Of course they received him very kindly; but it was my letter that did it. I could not put brains into him! Moreover, he seems to be a queer sort of man. I hear that he was mad at the national rejoicings over my coming home. You ought to have sent a brainier man anyway, for the Parliament of Religions has been made a farce of in the Hindu mind by Dr. Barrows. On metaphysical lines no nation on earth can hold a candle to the Hindus; and curiously all the fellows that come over here from Christian land have that one antiquated foolishness of an argument that because the Christians are powerful and rich and the Hindus are not, so Christianity must be better than Hinduism. To which the Hindus very aptly retort that, that is the very reason why Hinduism is a religion and Christianity is not; because,in this beastly world it is blackguardism and that alone whichprospers, virtue always suffers. It seems, however advanced the Western nations are in scientific culture, they are mere babies in metaphysical and spiritual education. Material science can only give worldly prosperity, whilst spiritual science is for eternal life. If there be no eternal life, still the enjoyment of spiritual thoughts as ideals is keener and makes a man happier, whilst the foolery of materialism leads to competition and undue ambition and ultimate death, individual and national.

This Darjeeling is a beautiful spot with a view of the glorious Kanchenjanga (28,146 ft.) now and then when the clouds permit it, and from a near hilltop one can catch a glimpse of Gauri Shankar (29,000 ft?) now and then. Then, the people here too are so picturesque, the Tibetans and Nepalese and, above all, the beautiful Lepcha women. Do you know one Colston Turnbull of Chicago? He was here a few weeks before I reached India. He seems to have had a great liking for me, with the result that Hindu people all liked him very much. What about Joe, Mrs. Adams, Sister Josephine, and all the rest of our friends? Where are our beloved Mills? Grinding slow but sure? I wanted to send some nuptial presents to Harriet, but with your ""terrible"" duties I must reserve it for some near future. Maybe I shall meet them in Europe very soon. I would have been very glad, of course, if you could announce your engagement, and I would fulfil my promise by filling up half a dozen papers in one letter....

My hair is turning grey in bundles, and my face is getting wrinkled up all over; that losing of flesh has given me twenty years of age more. And now I am losing flesh rapidly, because I am made to live upon meat and meat alone — no bread, no rice, no potatoes, not even a lump of sugar in my coffee!! I am living with a Brahmin familywho all dress in knickerbockers, women excepted of course! I am also in knickers. I would have given you a surprise if you had seen me bounding from rock to rock like a chamois, or galloping might and main up and down mountain roads.

I am very well here, for life in the plains has become a torture. I cannot put the tip of my nose out into the streets, but there is a curious crowd!! Fame is not all milk and honey!! I am going to train a big beard; now it is turning grey. It gives a venerable appearance and saves one from American scandal-mongers! O thou white hair, how much thou canst conceal, all glory unto thee, Hallelujah!

The mail time is nearly up, so I finish. Good dreams, good health, all blessings attend you.

With love to father and mother and you all,","Yours,

<p>DEAR <a name=""txt2""></a>SIR,<a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 392'--></p>
<p>I hear some unavoidable domestic grief has come upon you. To
you,&nbsp; a man of wisdom, what can this misery do? Yet the
amenities of friendly intercourse, incidental to relative existence in
this world, require my making mention of it. Those moments of grief,
however, very often bring out a better spiritual realisation. As if for
a while the
<!--'Volume 6 Page 393'-->clouds withdraw and the sun of
truth shines out. In the case of some, half of the bondage is loosened.
Of all bondages the greatest is that of position &#8212; the fear of
reputation is stronger than the fear of death; but even this bondage
appears to relax a little. As if the mind sees for a moment that it is
much better to listen to the indwelling Lord than to the opinions of
men. But again the clouds close up, and this indeed is Mâyâ. </p>
<p>Though for a long time I had no direct correspondence with
you, yet I have often been receiving from others almost all the news
about you. Some time ago you kindly sent me to England a copy of a
translation of the Gita. The cover only bore a line of your
handwriting. The few words in acknowledgment of this gift, I am told,
raised doubts in your mind about my old affection towards you. </p>
<p>Please know these doubts to be groundless. The reason of that
laconic acknowledgment is that I was given to see, during four or five
years, only that one line of your handwriting on the cover of an
English Gita, from which fact I thought, if you had no leisure to write
more, would you have leisure enough to read much? Secondly, I learnt,
you were particularly the friend of white-skinned missionaries of the
Hindu religion and the roguish black natives were repelling! There was
apprehension on this score. Thirdly, I am a Mlechchha, Shudra, and so
forth; I eat anything and everything, and with anybody and everybody &#8212;
and that in public both abroad and here. In my views, besides, much
perversion has supervened &#8212; one attributeless absolute Brahman, I see,
I fairly understand, and I see in some particular individuals the
special manifestations of that Brahman; if those individuals are called
by the name of God, I can well follow &#8212; otherwise the mind does not
feel inclined towards intellectual theorisings such as the postulated
Creator and the like. </p>
<p>Such a God I have seen in my life, and his commands I live to
follow. The Smritis and the Puranas are produc
<!--'Volume 6 Page 394'-->tions of men of limited
intelligence and are full of fallacies, errors, the feelings of class
and malice. Only parts of them breathing broadness of spirit and love
are acceptable, the rest are to be rejected. The Upanishads and the
Gita are the true scriptures; Rama, Krishna, Buddha, Chaitanya, Nanak,
Kabir, and so on are the true Avatâras, for they had their hearts broad
as the sky &#8212; and above all, Ramakrishna. Ramanuja, Shankara etc., seem
to have been mere Pundits with much narrowness of heart. Where is that
love, that weeping heart at the sorrow of others? &#8212; Dry pedantry of the
Pundit &#8212; and the feeling of only oneself getting to salvation
hurry-scurry! But is that going to be possible, sir? Was it ever likely
or will it ever be so? Can anything be attained with any shred of ""I""
left anyhow? </p>
<p>Another great discrepancy: the conviction is daily gaining on
my mind that the idea of caste is the greatest dividing factor and the
root of Maya; all caste either on the principle of birth or of merit is
bondage: Some friends advise, ""True, lay all that at heart, but
outside, in the world of relative experience, distinctions like caste
must needs be maintained."" ... The idea of oneness at heart (with a
craven impotence of effort, that is to say), and outside, the
hell-dance of demons &#8212; oppression and persecution &#8212; ay, the dealer of
death to the poor, but if the Pariah be wealthy enough, ""Oh, he is the
protector of religion!"" </p>
<p>Over and above, I come to see from my studies that the
disciplines of religion are not for the Shudra; if he exercises any
discrimination about food or about going out to foreign lands, it is
all useless in his case, only so much labour lost. I am a Shudra, a
Mlechchha, so I have nothing to do with all that botheration. To me
what would Mlechchha's food matter or Pariah's? It is in the books
written by priests that madnesses like that of caste are to be found,
and not in books revealed from God. Let the priests enjoy the
<!--'Volume 6 Page 395'-->fruits of their ancestors'
achievement, while I follow the word of God, for my good lies there. </p>
<p>Another truth I have realised is that altruistic service only
is religion, the rest, such as ceremonial observances, are madness &#8212;
even it is wrong to hanker after one's own salvation. Liberation is
only for him who gives up everything for others, whereas others who tax
their brains day and night harping on ""my salvation"", ""my salvation"",
wander about with their true well-being ruined, both present and
prospective; and this I have seen many a time with my own eyes.
Reflecting on all these sundry matters, I had no heart for writing a
letter to you. If notwithstanding all these discrepancies, you find
your attachment for me intact, I shall feel it to be a very happy issue
indeed. </p>

i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix, xxxi - xxxiii and
cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written to Pramadadas Mitra
of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose profound erudition and piety
Swamiji had the highest regard. These letters are most interesting
being written (except the last) at a time when, after his Master's
passing away, Swamiji was leading a wandering monk's life. In the early
days he used to sign his name as Narendranath, though his now famous
name, Vivekananda, is printed in all these pages for easy comprehension.</li>

is the last letter written to Pramada Das Mitra. It is a bold challenge
to the old love and spiritual fellowship of the two representative
minds of that age, and as such, Swamiji states his own case in it in
all its extreme trend and tendency so as to demand of his correspondent
a sincere depth of love and of the power to harmonise.</li>

<p class=""center"">(<i>Translated from Sanskrit</i>)</p>
<p class=""right"">ALMORA, <br>
<i>1st June, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SHUDDHANANDA, </p>
<p>Glad to know from your letter that all are doing well there,
and to go through the news in detail. I too am in better health; the
rest you will know from Dr. Shashi<!--'Volume 6 Page 397'-->
Bhushan. Let the teaching go on for the present in the method revised
by Brahmananda, and if any changes ar needed in future, have them done.
But it should never be lost sight of that this must be done with the
consent of all. </p>
<p>I am now living in a garden belonging to a merchant situated a
little to the north of Almora. Before me are the snow-peaks of the
Himalayas looking, in the reflection of the sun, like a mass of silver,
a delight to the heart. By taking free air, regular diet, and plenty of
exercise, I have grown strong and healthy in body. But I hear the
Yogananda is very ill. I am inviting him to come here But then, he
fears the mountain air and water. I wrote to him today, saying, ""Stay
in this garden for some day' and if you find your illness shows no
improvement, you may go to Calcutta."" He will do as he pleases. </p>
<p>At Almora, every evening Achyutananda gathers the people
together and reads to them the Gita and other Shâstras. Many residents
of the town, as also soldiers from the cantonment, come there daily. I
learn also that he is appreciated by all. </p>
<p>The Bengali interpretation that you have given of the
Shloka&nbsp;<a name=""txt1""></a><span lang=""sa"">&#2351;&#2366;&#2357;&#2366;&#2344;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2341;&#2307;</span><a class=""fnote"" href=""#txt2"">1</a>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 397'-->etc., does not seem to me to be
right. The interpretation in question
is this: ""When (the land) is flooded with water, what is the use of
drinking water?"" If the law of nature be such that when a land is
flooded with water, drinking it is useless, that through certain air
passages or through any other recondite way people's thirst may be
allayed, then only can this novel interpretation be relevant, otherwise
not. It is Shankara whom you should follow. Or you may explain it in
this way: As, even when whole tracts are flooded with water, small
pools are also of great use to the thirsty<!--'Volume 6 Page 398'-->
(that is to say, just a little water suffices him, and he says, as it
were, ""Let the vast sheet of water be, even a little of water will
satisfy my object.""), of identical use are the whole Vedas to a learned
Brahmin. As even when the land is overflooded, one's concern lies in
drinking the water and no more, so in all the Vedas illumination alone
is the concern. </p>
<p>Here is another interpretation which hits better the meaning
the author wishes to convey: Even when the land is overflooded, it is
only that water which is drinkable and salutary, that people seek for,
and no other kind. There are various kinds of water, which differ in
quality and properties &#8212; even though the land be flooded over &#8212;
according to the differences in property of their substratum, the soil.
Likewise a skilful Brahmin, too, will, for the quenching of the worldly
thirst, choose from that sea of words known as the Vedas, which is
flooded over with diverse courses of knowledge, that which alone will
be of potence to lead to liberation. And it is the knowledge of the
Brahman which will do this. </p>
<p>With blessing and good wishes.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>

DEAR SHUDDHANANDA,

Glad to know from your letter that all are doing well there, and to go through the news in detail. I too am in better health; the rest you will know from Dr. ShashiBhushan. Let the teaching go on for the present in the method revised by Brahmananda, and if any changes ar needed in future, have them done. But it should never be lost sight of that this must be done with the consent of all.

I am now living in a garden belonging to a merchant situated a little to the north of Almora. Before me are the snow-peaks of the Himalayas looking, in the reflection of the sun, like a mass of silver, a delight to the heart. By taking free air, regular diet, and plenty of exercise, I have grown strong and healthy in body. But I hear the Yogananda is very ill. I am inviting him to come here But then, he fears the mountain air and water. I wrote to him today, saying, ""Stay in this garden for some day' and if you find your illness shows no improvement, you may go to Calcutta."" He will do as he pleases.

At Almora, every evening Achyutananda gathers the people together and reads to them the Gita and other Shâstras. Many residents of the town, as also soldiers from the cantonment, come there daily. I learn also that he is appreciated by all.

The Bengali interpretation that you have given of the Shlokaयावानार्थः1etc., does not seem to me to be right. The interpretation in question is this: ""When (the land) is flooded with water, what is the use of drinking water?"" If the law of nature be such that when a land is flooded with water, drinking it is useless, that through certain air passages or through any other recondite way people's thirst may be allayed, then only can this novel interpretation be relevant, otherwise not. It is Shankara whom you should follow. Or you may explain it in this way: As, even when whole tracts are flooded with water, small pools are also of great use to the thirsty(that is to say, just a little water suffices him, and he says, as it were, ""Let the vast sheet of water be, even a little of water will satisfy my object.""), of identical use are the whole Vedas to a learned Brahmin. As even when the land is overflooded, one's concern lies in drinking the water and no more, so in all the Vedas illumination alone is the concern.

Here is another interpretation which hits better the meaning the author wishes to convey: Even when the land is overflooded, it is only that water which is drinkable and salutary, that people seek for, and no other kind. There are various kinds of water, which differ in quality and properties — even though the land be flooded over — according to the differences in property of their substratum, the soil. Likewise a skilful Brahmin, too, will, for the quenching of the worldly thirst, choose from that sea of words known as the Vedas, which is flooded over with diverse courses of knowledge, that which alone will be of potence to lead to liberation. And it is the knowledge of the Brahman which will do this.

With blessing and good wishes.","Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.",,558,2,0

many of our people, and that was all I wanted. Let things have their
course and Karma its sway. I have no bonds here below. I have seen
life, and it is all self &#8212; life is for self, love for self, honour for
self, everything for self. I look back and scarcely find any action I

done anything specially good or great, but the world is so little, life

that human beings, rational souls, should be running after this self &#8212;

is love that gives you the supernatural powers, love that gives you
Bhakti, love that gives illumination, and love, again, that leads to
emancipation. This indeed is worship, worship of the Lord in the human

raise a fund with the help of another band of boys; set one or two of
them to work at some place, and begin somewhere else. Spread in that
way, and go on inspecting them. You will see that the work will
gradually become permanent, and spread of religion and education will
follow as a matter of course. I have given particular instructions to
them in Calcutta. Do that kind of work, and I shall carry you on my

I do not think I shall be able to regain my usual vigour till winter
next. I had a letter from Joe saying that you are both coming to India.

<p>I do not think any European or American will be of any service

which a Mlechchha is made to undergo here. Even Goodwin smarts now and
then and has to be called to order. Goodwin is doing good work, as he
is a man and can mix with the people. Women have no place in men's
society here, and she can do good only among her own sex in India. The

yet, and do not know whether they will be of any in the future. With

Mountains and rivers, trees and plants, men and women, beasts and birds — all vie with one another for excellence. I feel a pang at heart not to have visited it so long. Please write to me in detail how you are doing, mentally and physically, andaccept my special blessings. I am constantly having your welfare at heart, know this for certain.","Yours sincerely,

<p>DEAR SARADA, </p>
<p>I am sorry to learn from your letter that you are not doing
well. If you can make an unpopular man popular, then I call you a
clever fellow. There is no prospect of work there in the future; it
would have been better had you gone rather to Dacca, or some other
place. However, it is a good thing that the work will close in
November. If you get very badly off in health, you should better come
away. There is much field for work in the Central Provinces; and even
without famine, there is no lack of poverty-stricken people in our
country. Wherever it is, if you can choose a site with an eye to
prospect, you are sure to turn out good work. However, be not sorry.
What one does has no destruction &#8212; no, never. Who knows, at that very
place the future may reap golden results. </p>
<p>I shall very soon begin my work in the plains. I have now no
need of travelling over the mountains. </p>
<p>Keep watch over your health.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours affectionately, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>

plan for the present, but do only what is possible<!--'Volume 6 Page 410'-->

must certainly have the orphanage, no hesitating in that. We must not
leave the girls in the lurch either. But then we must have a lady
superintendent for an orphanage of girls. I believe Mother will be a
very good hand for that. Or engage for this task some aged widow of the
village who has no issue. And there must be separate places for the
boys and girls. Captain Sevier is ready to send you money to help in
this. Nedou's Hotel, Lahore &#8212; that is his address. If you write to him,
write the words, ""To wait arrival"", on the letter. I am soon going to
Rawalpindi, tomorrow or the day after; then I visit Lahore and other
places via Jammu, and return to Rajputana via Karachi etc. </p>
<p>I am doing well.</p>

<p>PS. You must admit Mohammedan boys, too, but never tamper with
their religion. The only thing you will have to do is to make separate
arrangements for their food etc., and teach them so that they may be
moral, manly, and devoted to doing good to others. This indeed is
religion. </p>

<p>Reached Murree from Kashmir in the evening of the day before
yesterday. Everybody had an enjoyable time of it, only Krishnalal
(Dhirananda) and Gupta (Sadananda) suffered now and then from fever,
which, however, was but slight. This Address is to be sent to the Raja
of Khetri. Have it printed in gilt etc. The Raja is expected at Bombay
about the 21st or 22nd of October. None of us is staying at Bombay at
present &#8212; if there be any, send him a copy so that he may present the
same to the Raja even on Board the ship, or somewhere in the city of
Bombay. Send the superior copy to Khetri. Have this passed in a meeting
and if any change is needed, no harm. Then sign it, all of you, only
leaving a blank for my name, and I shall sign it on going to Khetri.
Let no pains be spared in this. </p>
<p>. . . Captain Sevier says he is very anxious for a site. He
wishes to have a spot near Mussoorie or in some<!--'Volume 6 Page 412'-->
other central place, as soon as possible. ... The thing is that we do
not want a place which is too cold, at the same time it must not be too
hot. Dehra Dun is unbearable in summer, but pleasant in winter;
Mussoorie itself is, I dare say, not the right place for many in
winter. Above or below it, that is, in British or Garhwal territory,
some land is sure to be found. At the same time there must be a supply
of water at the place throughout the year, for drinking purposes and
for everyday use. My plan is this: With only Achyutananda and Gupta I
go from Murree to Rawalpindi, thence to Jammu, thence to Lahore, and
from Lahore straight to Karachi. ... Give my hearty love and blessings
to Shashi Babu. I see that Master Mahashaya has buckled to work after
such a long time. Give him my special love and greetings. To see him,
with his feminine retiringness, stirred to work, my courage has gone up
by leaps and bounds. I am writing to him tomorrow even. Victory to the

<p>DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra) </p>
<p>It is a matter of deep regret that in spite of my earnest
wishes, I do not find it feasible to go to Karachi this time and see
you. First, because Captain and Mrs. Sevier, who have come from England
and are travelling with me for the last nine months nearly, are very
anxious to buy some land at Dehra Dun and start an orphanage there. It
is their special request that I should go and open the work. This makes
it unavoidable to go to Dehra Dun. </p>
<p>Secondly, owing to my kidney troubles I cannot count upon a
long life. Even now it is one of my desires to start a Math in
Calcutta, towards which as yet I could do nothing. Moreover, the people
of my country have withheld the little help that they used to give to
our Math of late. They have got a notion that I have brought plenty of
money from England! Over and above that, it is impossible to celebrate
Shri Ramakrishna's festival this year, for the proprietors of Rasmani's
garden would not let me go there, as I am returned from the West! Hence
my first duty lies in seeing the few friends we have in Rajputana and
trying my best to have a centre in Calcutta. For these reasons I have
been very sorry to postpone my tour to Sindh at present. I shall try my
best to go there via Rajputana and Kathiawar. Please do not be sorry.
Never for a day do I forget you all. But duty must be<!--'Volume 6 Page 414'-->
done first. It will ease me of my anxiety when a Math is established in
Calcutta. Then I can hope that the work for which I struggled all my
life through all sorts of privation and suffering will not die out
after I cease to live in this body. I start for Dehra Dun this very
day. After a week's stay there, to Rajputana, thence to Kathiawar, and
so on. </p>

Moreover, the people of my country have withheld the little help that they used to give to our Math of late. They have got a notion that I have brought plenty of money from England! Over and above that, it is impossible to celebrate Shri Ramakrishna's festival this year, for the proprietors of Rasmani's garden would not let me go there, as I am returned from the West! Hence my first duty lies in seeing the few friends we have in Rajputana and trying my best to have a centre in Calcutta. For these reasons I have been very sorry to postpone my tour to Sindh at present. I shall try my best to go there via Rajputana and Kathiawar. Please do not be sorry. Never for a day do I forget you all. But duty must bedone first. It will ease me of my anxiety when a Math is established in Calcutta. Then I can hope that the work for which I struggled all my life through all sorts of privation and suffering will not die out after I cease to live in this body. I start for Dehra Dun this very day. After a week's stay there, to Rajputana, thence to Kathiawar, and so on.

With blessings,","Yours sincerely,

<p>DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra) </p>
<p>I have duly received your letter and that of dear Haripada. Of
course you have ample reason to feel sorry for, but you see, I couldn't
help it. And what took me here also became a fiasco; neither could I go
to Sindh. It is the Lord's will. Now, I have an idea of proceeding to
Calcutta through Rajputana, Kathiawar, and Sindh. But some difficulty
may crop up on the way. If all goes well, I am certainly coming to
Sindh. You must have undergone a lot of difficulty in coming to
Hyderabad by arranging for leave etc. Any least trouble undergone, is
bound to produce its excellent results. Friday next I shall leave this
place, and have a mind to go via Saharanpur to Rajputana direct. I am
doing well now, and trust you too are in health and peace of mind. . .

<p>MY DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>You are perfectly right; I am brutal, very indeed. But about
the tenderness etc., that is my fault. I wish I had less, much less of
that &#8212; that is my weakness &#8212; and alas! all my sufferings have come from
that. Well, the municipality is trying to tax us out &#8212; good; that is my
fault as I did not make the Math public property by a deed of trust. I
am very sorry I use harsh language to my boys,<!--'Volume 6 Page 420'-->
but they also know I love them more than anybody else on earth. I may
have had Divine help &#8212; true; but oh, the pound of blood every bit of
Divine help has been to me!! I would be gladder and a better man
without that. The present looks very gloomy indeed; but I am a fighter
and must die fighting, not give way &#8212; that is why I get crazy at the
boys. I don't ask them to fight, but not to hinder my fight. </p>
<p>I don't grudge my fate. But oh! now I want a man, one of my
boys, to stand by me and fight against all odds! Don't you vex
yourself; if anything is to be done in India, my presence is necessary;
and I am much better in health; possibly the sea will make me better.
Anyway I did not do anything this time in America except bother my
friends. Possibly Joe will help me out with the passage, and I have
some money with Mr. Leggett. I have hopes of collecting some money in
India yet. I did not see any of my friends in different parts of India.
I have hope of collecting the fifteen thousand that will make up the
fifty thousand, and a deed of trust will bring down the municipal
taxes. If I cannot collect that &#8212; it is better to struggle and die for
it than vegetate here in America. My mistakes have been great; but
everyone of them was from too much love. How I hate <i>love</i>!
Would I never had any Bhakti! Indeed, I wish I could be an Advaitist,
calm and heartless. Well, this life is done. I will try in the next. I
am sorry, especially now, that I have done more injury to my friends
than there have been blessings on them. The peace, the quiet I am
seeking, I never found. </p>
<p>I went years ago to the Himalayas, never to come back; and my
sister committed suicide, the news reached me there, and that weak
heart flung me off from that prospect of peace! It is the weak heart
that has driven me out of India to seek some help for those I love, and
here I am! Peace have I sought, but the heart, that seat of Bhakti,
would not allow me to find it. Struggle and<!--'Volume 6 Page 421'-->
torture, torture and struggle. Well, be it then, since it is my fate,
and the quicker it is over, the better. They say I am impulsive, but
look at the circumstances!!! I am sorry I have been the cause of pain
to you, to you above all, who love me so much, who have been so, so
kind. But it is done &#8212; was a fact. I am now going to cut the knot or
die in the attempt.</p>
<p class=""right"">Ever your son, <br>
VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p><br>
PS. As Mother wants it, so let it be. I am going to beg of Joe a
passage via San Francisco to India. If she gives it, I start
immediately via Japan. It would take a month. In India, I think, I can
raise some money to keep things straight or on a better footing &#8212; at
least to leave things where I get them all muddled. The end is getting
very dark and very much muddled; well, I expected it so. Don't think I
give in in a moment. Lord bless you; if the Lord has made me His hack
to work and die on the streets, let Him have it. I am more cheerful
just now after your letter than I was for years &#8212; <i>Wah Guru ki
Fateh</i>! Victory unto the Guru!! Yes, let the world come, the
hells come, the gods come, let Mother come, I fight and do not give in.
Râvana got his release in three births by fighting the Lord Himself! It
is glorious to fight Mother. </p>

much more, than I deserved ever. </p>

<p>Yours of the &#8212; reached me today at Pasadena. I see Joe has
missed you at Chicago &#8212; although I have not heard anything from them
yet from New York. </p>
<p>There was a bundle of English newspapers from England with a
line on the envelope expressing good wishes for me and signed, F.H.M.
Nothing important was in those, however. I would have written a letter
to Miss Müller, but I do not know the address; then I was afraid to

Yours of the — reached me today at Pasadena. I see Joe has missed you at Chicago — although I have not heard anything from them yet from New York.

There was a bundle of English newspapers from England with a line on the envelope expressing good wishes for me and signed, F.H.M. Nothing important was in those, however. I would have written a letter to Miss Müller, but I do not know the address; then I was afraid to frighten her.

<p>MY DEAR AKHANDANANDA, </p>
<p>I am very glad to receive your letter and go through the
details of news. Learning and wisdom are superfluities, the surface
glitter merely, but it is the heart that is the seat of all power. It
is not in the brain but in the heart that the Atman, possessed of
knowledge, power, and activity, has Its seat. ""<span lang=""sa"">&#2358;&#2340;&#2306;
&#2330;&#2376;&#2325;&#2366; &#2330; &#2361;&#2371;&#2342;&#2351;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;
&#2344;&#2366;&#2337;&#2381;&#2351;&#2307;</span> &#8212; The nerves of the heart
are a hundred and one"" etc. The chief nerve-centre near the heart,
called the sympathetic ganglia, is where the Atman has Its citadel. The
more heart you will be able to manifest, the greater will be the
victory you achieve. It is only a few that understand the language of
the brain, but everyone from the Creator down to a clump of grass,
understands the language that comes from the heart. But then, in our
country, it is a case of rousing men that are, as it were, dead. It
will take time, but if you have infinite patience and perseverance,
success is bound to come. No mistake in that. </p>
<p>How are the English officials to blame? Is the family, of
whose unnatural cruelty you have written, an isolated one in India? Or,
are there plenty of such? It is the same story all over the country.
But then, it is not as a result of pure wickedness that the selfishness
commonly met with in our country has come. This bestial selfishness is
the outcome of centuries of failure and repression. It is not real
selfishness, but deep-rooted despair. It will be cored at the first
inkling of success. It is only this that the English officials are
noticing all round, so how can they have faith at the very<!--'Volume 6 Page 426'-->
outset? But tell me, do they not sympathise with any real work that
they meet with? . . . </p>
<p>In these days of dire famine, flood, disease, and pestilence,
tell me where your Congressmen are. Will it do merely to say, ""Hand the
government of the country over to us""? And who is there to listen to
them? If a man does work, has he to open his mouth to ask for anything?
If there be two thousand people like you working in several districts,
won't it be the turn of the English themselves to consult you in
matters of political moment? ""<span lang=""sa"">&#2360;&#2381;&#2357;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2381;&#2351;&#2350;&#2369;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2375;&#2340;&#2381;&#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2381;&#2334;&#2307;

anything to anybody, or quarrelling with any. Whoever will assist in
this work of the Divine Mother of the universe, will have Her grace,

&#8212; all in
good time. Many a little makes a mickle. When a great work is being
done, when the foundations are laid or a road constructed, when
superhuman energy is needed &#8212; it is one or two extraordinary men who
silently and noiselessly work through a world of obstacles and
difficulties. When thousands of people are benefited, there is a great
tomtoming, and the whole country is loud in notes of praise. But then
the machine has already been set agoing, and even a boy can work it, or
a fool add to it some impetus. Grasp this that, that benefit done to a
village or two, that orphanage with its twenty orphans, those ten or
twenty workers &#8212; all these are enough; they form the nucleus, never to
be destroyed. From these, hundreds of thousands of people will be
benefited in time. Now we want half a dozen lions, then excellent work
will be turned out by even hundreds of jackals. . . </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 427'-->
<p>If orphan girls happen to come to your hands for shelter, you
must take them in above all else. Otherwise, Christian missionaries
will take them, poor things, away! What matters it that you have no
particular arrangements for them? Through the Divine Mother's will,
they will be provided for. When you get a horse, never you worry about
the whip. ... Get together whomsoever you can lay your hands on, no
picking and choosing now &#8212; everything will be set right in course of
time. In every attempt there are many obstacles to cope with, but
gradually the path becomes smooth. </p>
<p>Convey to the European officer many thanks from me. Work on
fearlessly &#8212; there is a hero! Bravo! Thrice well done! The starting of
a centre at Bhagalpur that you have written about is no doubt a good
idea &#8212; enlightening the schoolboys and things of that sort. But our
mission is for the destitute, the poor, and the illiterate peasantry
and labouring classes, and if, after everything has been done for them
first, there is spare time, then only for the gentry. Those peasants
and labouring people will be won over by love. Afterwards it will be
they who will collect small sums and start missions at their own
villages, and gradually, from among those very men, teachers will
spring. </p>
<p>Teach some boys and girls of the peasant classes the rudiments
of learning and infuse a number of ideas into their brains. Afterwards
the peasants of each village will collect funds and have one of these
in their village. ""<span lang=""sa"">&#2313;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2375;&#2342;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2344;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2350;&#2381;</span>
&#8212; One must
raise oneself by one's own exertions"" &#8212; this holds good in all spheres.
We help them to help themselves. That they are supplying you with your
daily bread is a real bit of work done. The moment they will come to
understand their own condition and feel the necessity of help and
improvement, know that your work is taking effect and is in the right
direction, while the little good that the moneyed classes, out of pity,
do to the poor, does not last, and ultimately it does nothing<!--'Volume 6 Page 428'-->
but harm to both parties. The peasants and labouring classes are in a
moribund condition, so what is needed is that the moneyed people will
only help them to regain their vitality, and nothing more. Then leave
the peasants and labourers to look to their own problem, to grapple
with and solve it. But then you must rake care not to set up
class-strife between the poor peasants, the labouring people, and
wealthy classes. Make it a point not to abuse the moneyed classes.

<p>I am much better and am growing very strong. I feel sometimes
that freedom is near at hand, and the tortures of the last two years
have been great lessons in many ways. Disease and misfortune come to do
us good in the long run, although at the time we feel that we are

dreams of happiness and misery &#8212; what are they? </p>

<p>MY DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita) </p>
<p>I am so glad at your good fortune. Things have got to come
round if we are steady. I am sure you will get all the money you
require here or in England. </p>
<p>I am working hard; and the harder I work, the better I feel.
This ill health has done me a great good, sure. I am really
understanding what non-attachment means. And I hope very soon to be
perfectly non-attached. </p>
<p>We put all our energies to concentrate and get attached to one
thing; but the other part, though equally difficult, we seldom pay any
attention to &#8212; the faculty of detaching ourselves at a moment's notice
from anything. </p>
<p>Both attachment and detachment perfectly developed make a man
great and happy. </p>
<p>I am so glad at Mrs. Leggett's gift of $1,000. She is working
up, wait. She has a great part to play in Ramakrishna's work, whether
she knows it or not. </p>
<p>I enjoyed your accounts of Prof. Geddes, and Joe has a funny
account of a clairvoyant. Things are just now beginning to turn. . . . </p>
<p>This letter, I think, Will reach you at Chicago. . . . </p>
<p>I had a nice letter from Max Gysic, the young Swiss who is a
great friend of Miss Souter. Miss Souter also sends her love, and they
ask to know the time when I come over to England. Many people are
inquiring, they say. </p>
<p>Things have got to come round &#8212; the seed must die underground
to come up as the tree. The last two years were the underground
rotting. I never had a struggle in the jaws of death, but it meant a

<p>I am so sorry Mr. Leggett resigned the presidentship. </p>

<p>After all, Joe, I am only the boy who used to listen with rapt
wonderment to the wonderful words of Ramakrishna under the Banyan at
Dakshineswar. That is my true nature; works and activities, doing good

<p>I am glad I was born, glad I suffered so, glad I did make big

The guide, the Guru, the leader, the teacher has passed away; the boy,

<p>You understand why I do not want to meddle with A&#8212;. Who am I
to meddle with anyone, Joe? I have long given up my place as a leader &#8212;
I have no right to raise my voice. Since the beginning of this year I
have not dictated anything in India. You know that. Many thanks for
what you and Mrs. Bull have been to me in the past. All blessings
follow you ever! The sweetest moments of my life have been when I was
drifting: I am drifting again &#8212; with the bright warm sun ahead and
masses of vegetation around &#8212; and in the heat everything is so still,
so calm &#8212; and I am drifting languidly &#8212; in the warm heart of the river!

<!--'Volume 6 Page 433'-->

Well, I keep quiet for fear of making further trouble.

You know my methods are extremely harsh and once roused I may rattle A— too much for his peace of mind.

I wrote to him only to tell him that his notions about Mrs. Bull are entirely wrong.

Workis always difficult; pray for me Joe that my works stop for ever, and my whole soul be absorbed in Mother. Her works, She knows.

You must be glad to be in London once more — the old friends, give them all my love and gratitude.

I am well, very well mentally. I feel the rest of the soul more shall that of the body. The battles are lost and won, I have bundled my things and am waiting for the great deliverer.

<h2>CLXI</h2>
<p class=""right"">6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS, PARIS, <br>
<i>25th Aug., 1900.</i></p>
<p>DEAR NIVEDITA, </p>
<p>Your letter reached me just now. Many thanks for the kind
expressions. </p>
<p>I gave a chance to Mrs. Bull to draw her money out of the
Math; and as she did not say anything about it, and the trust deeds
were waiting here to be executed, I got them executed duly at the
British Consulate; and they are on their way to India now. </p>
<p>Now I am free, as I have kept no power or authority or
position for me in the work. I also have resigned the presidentship of
the Ramakrishna Mission. </p>
<p>The Math etc., belong now to the immediate disciples of
Ramakrishna except myself. The presidentship is now Brahmananda's &#8212;
next it will fall on Premananda etc., etc., in turn. </p>
<p>I am so glad a whole load is off me, now I am happy. I have
served Ramakrishna through mistakes and success for 20 years now. I
retire for good and devote the rest of my life to myself. </p>
<p>I no longer represent anybody, nor am I responsible to
anybody. As to my friends, I had a morbid sense of obligation. I have
thought well and find I owe nothing to anybody; if anything, I have
given my best energies, unto death almost, and received only hectoring
and mischief-making and botheration. I am done with everyone here and
in India. </p>
<p>Your letter indicates that I am jealous of your new friends.
You must know once for all, I am born without jealousy, without
avarice, without the desire to rule &#8212; whatever other vices I am born
with. </p>
<p>I never directed you before; now, after I am nobody in the
work, I have no direction whatever. I only know this<!--'Volume 6 Page 435'-->
much: So long as you serve ""Mother"" with a whole heart, She will be
your guide. </p>
<p>I never had any jealousy about what friends you made. I never
criticised my brethren for mixing up in anything. Only I do believe the
Western people have the peculiarity of trying to force upon others
whatever seems good to them, forgetting that what is good for you may
not be good for others. As such, I am afraid you might try to force
upon others whatever turn your mind might take in contact with new
friends. That was the only reason I sometimes tried to stop any
particular influence, and nothing else. </p>
<p>You are free, have your own choice, your own work. ... </p>
<p>Friends or foes, they are all instruments in Her hands to help
us work out our own Karma, through pleasure or pain. As such ""Mother""
bless them all. </p>
<p>With all love and blessings,</p>

</body></html>",3641,"DEAR NIVEDITA,

Your letter reached me just now. Many thanks for the kind expressions.

I gave a chance to Mrs. Bull to draw her money out of the Math; and as she did not say anything about it, and the trust deeds were waiting here to be executed, I got them executed duly at the British Consulate; and they are on their way to India now.

Now I am free, as I have kept no power or authority or position for me in the work. I also have resigned the presidentship of the Ramakrishna Mission.

The Math etc., belong now to the immediate disciples of Ramakrishna except myself. The presidentship is now Brahmananda's — next it will fall on Premananda etc., etc., in turn.

I am so glad a whole load is off me, now I am happy. I have served Ramakrishna through mistakes and success for 20 years now. I retire for good and devote the rest of my life to myself.

I no longer represent anybody, nor am I responsible to anybody. As to my friends, I had a morbid sense of obligation. I have thought well and find I owe nothing to anybody; if anything, I have given my best energies, unto death almost, and received only hectoring and mischief-making and botheration. I am done with everyone here and in India.

Your letter indicates that I am jealous of your new friends. You must know once for all, I am born without jealousy, without avarice, without the desire to rule — whatever other vices I am born with.

I never directed you before; now, after I am nobody in the work, I have no direction whatever. I only know thismuch: So long as you serve ""Mother"" with a whole heart, She will be your guide.

I never had any jealousy about what friends you made. I never criticised my brethren for mixing up in anything. Only I do believe the Western people have the peculiarity of trying to force upon others whatever seems good to them, forgetting that what is good for you may not be good for others. As such, I am afraid you might try to force upon others whatever turn your mind might take in contact with new friends. That was the only reason I sometimes tried to stop any particular influence, and nothing else.

You are free, have your own choice, your own work. ...

Friends or foes, they are all instruments in Her hands to help us work out our own Karma, through pleasure or pain. As such ""Mother"" bless them all.

With all love and blessings,","Yours affectionately,VIVEKANANDA.",,435,2,0

<p>Such is life &#8212; grind, grind; and yet what else are we to do?
Grind, grind! Something will come &#8212; some way will be opened. If it does
not, as it probably never will &#8212; then, then &#8212; what then? All our

Lord!! How can the future be any better? That must be an effect of this
one &#8212; at least like this, if not worse! </p>

appreciative already. Talk to all the world &#8212; of the eternal riddle,
the eternal spool of fate, whose thread-end no one finds and everyone
seems to find, at least to his own satisfaction, at least for a time &#8212;

<i>3rd Sept., 1900.</i></p>
<p>DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Francis Leggett.) </p>
<p>We had a congress of cranks here in this house. </p>
<p>The representatives came from various countries, from India in
the south, to Scotland in the north, with England and America
buttressing the sides. </p>
<p>We were having great difficulty in electing the president, for
though Dr. James (Professor William James) was there, he was more
mindful of the blisters raised on him by Mrs.
<!--'Volume 6 Page 437'-->Melton (probably a magnetic
healer) than solution of world problems. </p>
<p>I proposed Joe (Josephine MacLeod), but she refused on the
ground of non-arrival of her new gown &#8212; and went to a corner to watch
the scene, from a coign of vantage. </p>
<p>Mrs. (Ole) Bull was ready, but Margot (Sister Nivedita)
objected to this meeting being reduced to a comparative philosophy
class. </p>
<p>When we were thus in a fix &#8212; up sprung a short, square, almost
round figure from the corner, and without any ceremony declared that
all difficulties will be solved, not only of electing a president but
of life itself, if we all took to worshipping the Sun God and Moon God.
He delivered his speech in five minutes; but it took his disciple, who
was present, fully three quarters of an hour to translate. In the
meanwhile, the master began to draw the rugs in your parlour up in a
heap, with the intention, as he said, of giving us an ocular
demonstration of the power of ""Fire God"", then and there. </p>
<p>At this juncture Joe interposed and insisted that she did not
want a fire sacrifice in her parlour; whereupon the Indian saint looked
daggers at Joe, entirely disgusted at the behaviour of one he
confidently believed to be a perfect convert to fire worship. </p>
<p>Then Dr. James snatched a minute from nursing his blisters and
declared that he would have something very interesting to speak upon
Fire God and his brethren, if he were not entirely occupied with the
evolution of Meltonian blisters. Moreover his great Master, Herbert
Spencer, not having investigated the subject before him, he would stick
to golden silence. </p>
<p>""Chutney is the thing"", said a voice near the door. We all
looked back and saw Margot. ""It is Chutney,"" she said, ""Chutney and
Kali, that will remove all difficulties of Life, and make it easy for
us to swallow all evils, and relish what is good."" But she stopped all
of a sudden
<!--'Volume 6 Page 438'-->and vehemently asserted that she
was not going to speak any further, as she has been obstructed by a
certain male animal in the audience in her speech. She was sure one man
in the audience had his head turned towards the window and was not
paying the attention proper to a lady, and though as to herself she
believed in the equality of the sexes, yet she wanted to know the
reason of that disgusting man's want of due respect for women. Then one
and all declared that they had been giving her the most undivided
attention, and all above the equal right, her due, but to no purpose.
Margot would have nothing to do with that horrible crowd and sat down. </p>
<p>Then Mrs. Bull of Boston took the floor and began to explain
how all the difficulties of the world were from not understanding the
true relation between the sexes. She said, ""The only panacea was a
right understanding of the proper persons, and then to find liberty in
love and freedom in liberty and motherhood, brotherhood, fatherhood,
Godhood, love in freedom and freedom in love, in the right holding up
of the true ideal in sex."" </p>
<p>To this the Scotch delegate vehemently objected and said that
as the hunter chased the goatherd, the goatherd the shepherd, the
shepherd the peasant, and the peasant drove the fisher into the sea,
now we wanted to fish out of the deep the fisher and let him fall upon
the peasant, the peasant upon the shepherd, and so on; and the web of
life will be completed and we will be all happy. He was not allowed to
continue his driving business long. In a second everyone was on his
feet, and we could only hear a confusion of voices &#8212; ""Sun God and Moon
God"", ""Chutney and Kali,"" ""Freedom holdings up right understanding,
sex, motherhood"", ""Never, the fisherman must go back to the shore"",
etc. Whereupon Joe declared that she was yearning to be the hunter for
the time and chase them all out of the house if they did not stop their
nonsense. </p>
<!--'Volume 6 Page 439'-->

<p>DEAR NIVEDITA, </p>
<p>We all work by bits, that is to say, in this cause. I try to
keep down the spring, but something or other happens, and the spring
goes whirr, and there you are &#8212; thinking, remembering, scribbling,
scrawling, and all that! </p>

The river is rising, flooding the banks; the ponds and tanks have
overflowed. I have just now returned from lending a hand in cutting a
deep drain to take off the water from the Math grounds. The rain-water
stands at places some feet high. My huge stork is full of glee, and so
are the ducks and geese. My tame antelope fled from the Math and gave
us some days of anxiety in finding him out. One of my ducks
unfortunately died yesterday. She had been gasping for breath more than
a week. One of my waggish old monks says, ""Sir, it is no use living in
this Kali-Yuga when ducks catch cold from damp and rain, and frogs
sneeze!"" </p>

iron in the water. I have found nothing agreeable here &#8212; neither the

spotless. She was all along a perfectly chaste woman<!--'Volume 7 Page 442'-->
and never behaved with __ in any relation but that of wife to husband,
and she was absolutely faithful. She came at too early an age to have
incurred any moral taint. After she had separated from __, she wrote to
him to say that she had never treated him as anything but her husband,
but that it was impossible for her to live with a man with a loose
character. His old office-bearers too believe him to be satanic in
character; but they consider __ a Devi (angel), and remark that it was
following her departure that __ lost all sense of shame. </p>
<p>My object in writing all this is that formerly I was not a

investigation I have come to know that it is all right. She is very
pure, pure from her infancy &#8212; I have not the least doubt about it. For
entertaining those doubts, you and I and everyone are guilty to her; I
make repeated salutations to her, and ask her pardon for my guilt. She
is not a liar. </p>
<p>I take this opportunity to record that such courage is

she had a lifelong ardent faith in religion also. </p>

places I have recently visited, this is the healthiest. The water of
Baidyanath is very bad &#8212; it leads to indigestion. Allahabad is very
congested. The few days I passed at Varanasi, I suffered from fever day
and night &#8212; the place is so malarious! Ghazipur has a very salubrious
climate &#8212; specially the quarter I am living in. I have visited Pavhari
Baba's house &#8212; there are high walls all<!--'Volume 7 Page 444'-->
round, and it is fashioned like an English bungalow. There is a garden
inside and big rooms and chimneys, etc. He allows nobody to enter. If
he is so inclined, he comes up to the door and speaks from inside &#8212;
that is all. One day I went and waited and waited in the cold and had
to return. I shall go to Varanasi on Sunday next. If the meeting with
the Babaji takes place in the meantime, all right, otherwise I bid him
good-bye. About Pramada Babu's place I shall write definitely from
Varanasi. If Kali Bhattacharya is determined to come, let him do so
after I leave for Varanasi on Sunday, but he should rather not. After a
few days' stay at Varanasi, I shall start for Hrishikesh. Pramada Babu
may accompany me. Please accept all of you my cordial greetings &#8212; and
blessing to Fakir, Ram, Krishnamayi, etc. </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours affectionately, <br>

<p><br>
PS. In my opinion, it will do you much good if you come and stay for
some time at Ghazipur. Here Satish will be able to secure a bungalow
for you, and there is a gentleman, Gagan Chandra Ray by name, who is
the head of the Opium Office and is exceedingly courteous,
philanthropic, and social &#8212; they will arrange for everything. The
house-rent is fifteen to twenty rupees; rice is dear, and milk sells at
sixteen to twenty seers a rupee; all other things are very cheap.
Besides, under the care of these gentlemen, there is no chance of any
difficulty. But it is slightly expensive &#8212; it will cost over forty to
fifty rupees. Varanasi is horribly malarious. I have never lived in
Pramada Babu's garden. He likes to have me always in his company. The
garden is indeed very beautiful, richly laid out, spacious, and open.
This time when I go, I shall live there and report to you.</p>

One day I went and waited and waited in the cold and had to return. I shall go to Varanasi on Sunday next. If the meeting with the Babaji takes place in the meantime, all right, otherwise I bid him good-bye. About Pramada Babu's place I shall write definitely from Varanasi. If Kali Bhattacharya is determined to come, let him do so after I leave for Varanasi on Sunday, but he should rather not. After a few days' stay at Varanasi, I shall start for Hrishikesh. Pramada Babu may accompany me. Please accept all of you my cordial greetings — and blessing to Fakir, Ram, Krishnamayi, etc.","Yours affectionately,VIVEKANANDA.","PS. In my opinion, it will do you much good if you come and stay for some time at Ghazipur. Here Satish will be able to secure a bungalow for you, and there is a gentleman, Gagan Chandra Ray by name, who is the head of the Opium Office and is exceedingly courteous, philanthropic, and social — they will arrange for everything. The house-rent is fifteen to twenty rupees; rice is dear, and milk sells at sixteen to twenty seers a rupee; all other things are very cheap. Besides, under the care of these gentlemen, there is no chance of any difficulty. But it is slightly expensive — it will cost over forty to fifty rupees. Varanasi is horribly malarious. I have never lived in Pramada Babu's garden. He likes to have me always in his company. The garden is indeed very beautiful, richly laid out, spacious, and open. This time when I go, I shall live there and report to you.",238,2,162

this place soon &#8212; it is impossible to avoid the Babaji's request. You
have expressed remorse at not having reaped any appreciable results by
serving the Sadhus. It is true, and yet not true; it is true if you
look towards ideal bliss; but if you look behind to the place from
which you started, you will find that before you were an animal, now
you are a man, and will be a god or God Himself in future. Moreover,
that sort of regret and dissatisfaction is very good; it is the prelude
to improvement. Without this none can rise. He who puts on a turban and
immediately sees the Lord, progresses thus far and no farther. You are
blessed indeed to have that constant dissatisfaction preying upon your
mind &#8212; rest assured that there is no danger for you. . . . You are a
keenly intelligent man, and know full well that patience is the best
means of success. In this respect I have no doubt that we light-headed
boys have much to learn from you. . . . You are a considerate man, and
I need not add anything. Man has two ears but one mouth. You specially
are given to plain-speaking and are chary of making large promises &#8212;
things that sometimes make me cross with you, but upon reflection I
find that it is you who have acted with discretion. ""Slow but sure.""
""What is lost in power is gained in speed."" However, in this world
everything depends upon one's words. To get an insight behind the words
(specially, with your economical spirit masking all) is not given to
all, and one must associate<!--'Volume 7 Page 446'--> long
with a man to be able to understand him. . . . Religion is not in
sects, nor in making a fuss &#8212; why do you forget these teachings of our
revered Master? Please help as far as it lies in you, but to judge what
came of it, whether it was turned to good or evil account, is perhaps

Babu has received, it will give him immense peace to serve Mother at
this moment. He is a very keen-witted person. And our beloved Master
had perfect confidence in you, used to dine nowhere else except at your
place, and, I have heard, Mother too has the fullest confidence in you.
In view of these, you will please bear and forbear all shortcomings of

<p>Received your kind note yesterday. I am very sorry to learn
that Suresh Babu's illness is extremely serious. What is destined will
surely happen. It is a matter of great regret that you too have fallen
ill. So long as egoism lasts, any shortcoming in adopting remedial
measures is to be considered as idleness &#8212; it is a fault and a guilt.
For one who has not that egoistic idea, the best course is to forbear.
The dwelling-place of the Jivâtman, this body, is a veritable means of

who neglects it is also to blame. Please act according to<!--'Volume 7 Page 448'-->

<p>DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),</p>
<p>I hasten to tender my heartfelt gratitude to you for your
letters of introduction. I have received a letter from Mr. Theles of
Chicago giving me the names of some of the delegates and other things
about the Congress. </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 450'-->
<p>Your professor of Sanskrit in his note to Miss Sanborn
mistakes me for Purushottama Joshi and states that there is a Sanskrit
library in Boston the like of which can scarcely be met with in India.
I would be so happy to see it. </p>
<p>Mr. Sanborn has written to me to come over to Saratoga on
Monday and I am going accordingly. I would stop then at a boarding
house called Sanatorium. If any news come from Chicago in the meanwhile
I hope you will kindly send it over to the Sanatorium, Saratoga. </p>
<p>You and your noble wife and sweet children have made an
impression in my brain which is simply indelible, and I thought myself
so much nearer to heaven when living with you. May He, the giver of all
gifts, shower on your head His choicest blessings. </p>
<p>Here are a few lines written as an attempt at poetry. Hoping
your love will pardon this infliction. </p>

<h2>X</h2>
<p class=""right"">CHICAGO, <br>
<i>2nd October, 1893</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),</p>
<p>I do not know what you are thinking of my long silence. In the
first place I dropped in on the Congress in the eleventh hour, and
quite unprepared; and that kept me very very busy for some time.
Secondly, I was speaking almost every day in the Congress and had no
time to write; and last and greatest of all &#8212; my kind friend, I owe so
much to you that it would have been an insult to your <i>ahetuka</i>
(unselfish) friendship to have written you business-like letters in a
hurry. The Congress is now over. </p>
<p>Dear brother, I was so so afraid to stand before that great
assembly of fine speakers and thinkers from all over the world and
speak; but the Lord gave me strength, and I almost every day heroically
(?) faced the platform and the audience. If I have done well, He gave
me the strength for it; if I have miserably failed &#8212; I knew that
beforehand &#8212; for I am hopelessly ignorant. </p>
<p>Your friend Prof. Bradley was very kind to me and he always
cheered me on. And oh! everybody is so kind here to me who am nothing &#8212;
that it is beyond my power of expression. Glory unto Him in the highest
in whose sight the poor ignorant monk from India is the same as the
learned divines of this mighty land. And how the Lord is helping me
every day of my life, brother &#8212; I sometimes wish for a life of [a]
million million ages to serve Him through the work, dressed in rags and
fed by charity. </p>
<p>Oh, how I wished that you were here to see some of our sweet
ones from India &#8212; the tender-hearted Buddhist Dharmapala, the orator
Mazoomdar &#8212; and realise that in that far-off and poor India there are
hearts that<!--'Volume 7 Page 454'--> beat in sympathy to
yours, born and brought up in this mighty and great country. </p>
<p>My eternal respects to your holy wife; and to your sweet
children my eternal love and blessings. </p>
<p>Col. Higginson, a very broad man, told me that your daughter
had written to his daughter about me; and he was very sympathetic to
me. I am going to Evanston tomorrow and hope to see Prof. Bradley
there. </p>
<p>May He make us all more and more pure and holy so that we may
live a perfect spiritual life even before throwing off this earthly
body.</p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p><br>
[The letter continues on a separate sheet of paper:]</p>
<p>I am now going to be reconciled to my life here. All my life I
have been taking every circumstance as coming from Him and calmly
adapting myself to it. At first in America I was almost out of my
water. I was afraid I would have to give up the accustomed way of being
guided by the Lord and <i>cater</i> for myself &#8212; and what
a horrid piece of mischief and ingratitude was that. I now clearly see
that He who was guiding me on the snow tops of the Himalayas and the
burning plains of India is here to help me and guide me. <i>Glory
unto Him</i> in the highest. So I have calmly fallen into my old
ways. Somebody or other gives me a shelter and food, somebody or other
comes to ask me to speak about Him, and I know He sends them and mine
is to obey. And then He is supplying my necessities, and His <i>will
be done</i>! </p>
<p>""He who rests [in] Me and gives up all other self-assertion
and struggles I carry to him whatever he needs"" (Gitâ). </p>
<p>So it is in Asia. So in Europe. So in America. So in the
deserts of India. So in the rush of business in America. For is He not
here also? And if He does not, I only would take for granted that He
wants that I<!--'Volume 7 Page 455'--> should lay aside
this three minutes' body of clay &#8212; and hope to lay it down gladly. </p>
<p>We may or may not meet, brother. He knows. You are great,
learned, and holy. I dare not preach to you or your wife; but to your
children I quote these passages from the Vedas &#8212; </p>
<p>""The four Vedas, sciences, languages, philosophy, and all
other learnings are only ornamental. The real learning, the true
knowledge is that which enables us to reach Him who is unchangeable in
His love."" </p>
<p>""How real, how tangible, how visible is He through whom the
skin touches, the eyes see, and the world gets its reality!"" </p>
<p>""Hearing Him nothing remains to be heard, </p>
<p>Seeing Him nothing remains to be seen, </p>
<p>Attaining Him nothing remains to be attained."" </p>
<p>""He is the eye of our eyes, the ear of our ears, the Soul of
our souls."" </p>
<p>He is nearer to you, my dears, than even your father and
mother. You are innocent and pure as flowers. Remain so, and He will
reveal Himself unto you. Dear Austin, when you are playing, there is
another playmate playing with you who loves you more than anybody else;
and Oh, He is so full of fun. He is always playing &#8212; sometimes with
great big balls which we call the sun and earth, sometimes with little
children like you and laughing and playing with you. How funny it would
be to see Him and play with Him! My dear, think of it. </p>
<p>Dear Adhyapakji, I am moving about just now. Only when I come
to Chicago, I always go to see Mr. and Mrs. Lyons, one of the noblest
couples I have seen here. If you would be kind enough to write to me,
kindly address it to the care of Mr. John B. Lyon, 262 Michigan Ave.,
Chicago. </p>
<p>""He who gets hold of the One in this world of many &#8212; the one

<p>DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright),</p>
<p>You would be glad to know that I am doing well here and that
almost everybody has been very kind to me, except of course the very
orthodox. Many of the men brought together here from far-off lands have
got projects and ideas and missions to carry out, and America is the
only place where there is a chance of success for everything. But I
thought better and have given up speaking about my project entirely &#8212;
because I am sure now &#8212; the heathen draws more than his project. So I
want to go to work earnestly for my own project only keeping the
project in the background and working like any other lecturer. </p>
<p>He who has brought me hither and has not left me yet will not
leave me ever I am here. You will be glad to know that I am doing well
and expect to do very well in the way of getting money. Of course I am
too green in the business but would soon learn my trade. I am very
popular in Chicago. So I want to stay here a little more and get money.
</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am going to lecture on Buddhism at the ladies'
fortnightly club &#8212; which is the most influential in this city. How to
thank you my kind friend or Him who brought you to me; for now I think
the success of my project probable, and it is you who have made it so. </p>
<p>May blessings and happiness attend every step of your progress
in this world. </p>
<p>My love and blessings to your children.</p>

is a beautiful young girl. I saw her twice, I do not remember her name.
So brainy, so beautiful, so spiritual, so unworldly! Lord bless her!

few points which I would take the liberty of correcting you in. </p>
<p>In the first place, I have not one word to say against any
religion or founder of religion in the world &#8212; whatever you may think
of our religion. All religions are sacred to me. Secondly, it is a
misstatement that I said that missionaries do not learn our
vernaculars. I still stick to my statement that few, if any, of them
pay any attention to Sanskrit; nor is it true that I said anything
against any religious body &#8212; except that I do insist on my statement
that India can never be converted to Christianity, and further I deny
that the conditions of the lower classes are made any better by
Christianity, and add that the majority of southern Indian Christians
are not only Catholics, but what they call themselves, caste
Christians, that is, they stick close to their castes, and I am
thoroughly persuaded that if the Hindu society gives up its exclusive<!--'Volume 7 Page 461'-->
policy, ninety per cent of them would rush back to Hinduism with all
its defects. </p>
<p>Lastly, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for calling me
your fellow-countryman. This is the first time any European foreigner,
born in India though he be, has dared to call a detested native by that
name &#8212; missionary or no missionary. Would you dare call me the same in
India? Ask your missionaries, born in India, to do the same &#8212; and those
not born, to treat them as fellow human beings. As to the rest, you
yourself would call me a fool if I admit that my religion or society
submits to be judged by strolling globe-trotters or story-writers'
narratives. </p>
<p>My brother &#8212; excuse me &#8212; what do you know of my society or
religion, though born in India? It is absolutely impossible &#8212; the
society is so closed; and over and above, everyone judges from his
preconceived standard of race and religion, does he not? Lord bless you
for calling me a fellow-countryman. There may still come a brotherly
love and fellowship between the East and West. </p>

<i>26th April, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTER (Miss Isabelle McKindley.),</p>
<p>Your letter reached me yesterday. You were perfectly right &#8212; I
enjoyed the fun of the lunatic Interior, (<i>Chicago Interior</i>,
a Presbyterian newspaper which opposed Swamiji. &#8212; Ed.) but the mail you
sent yesterday from India was really, as Mother Church says in her
letter, a good news after a long interval. There is a beautiful letter
from Dewanji. The old man &#8212; Lord bless him &#8212; offers as usual to help
me. Then there was a little pamphlet published in Calcutta about me &#8212;
revealing that once at least in my life the prophet has been honoured
in his own country. There are extracts from American and Indian papers
and magazines about me. The extracts printed from Calcutta papers were
especially gratifying, although the strain is so fulsome that I refuse
to send the pamphlet over to you. They call me illustrious, wonderful,
and all sorts of nonsense, but they forward me the gratitude of the
whole nation. Now I do not care what they even of my own people say
about me &#8212; except for one thing. I have an old mother. She has suffered
much all her life and in the midst of all she could bear to give me up
for the service of God and man; but to have given up the most beloved
of her children &#8212; her hope &#8212; to live a beastly immoral life in a far
distant country, as Mazoomdar was telling in Calcutta, would have
simply killed her. But the Lord is great, none can injure His children.
</p>
<p>The cat is out of the bag &#8212; without my seeking at all. And who
do you think is the editor of one of our leading papers which praise me
so much and thank<!--'Volume 7 Page 463'--> God that I
came to America to represent Hinduism? Mazoomdar's cousin!! &#8212; Poor
Mazoomdar &#8212; he has injured his cause by telling lies through jealousy.
Lord knows I never attempted any defence. </p>
<p>I read the article of Mr. Gandhi in the <i>Forum</i>
before this. </p>
<p>If you have got the <i>Review of Reviews</i> of
last month &#8212; read to mother the testimony about the Hindus in
connection with the opium question in India by one of the highest
officials of the English in India. He compares the English with the
Hindus and lauds the Hindu to the skies. Sir Lepel Griffin was one of
the bitterest enemies of our race. What made this change of front? </p>
<p>I had a very good time in Boston at Mrs. Breed's &#8212; and saw
Prof. Wright. I am going to Boston again. The tailor is making my new
gown. I am going to speak at Cambridge University [Harvard] and would
be the guest of Prof. Wright there. They write grand welcomes to me in
the Boston papers. </p>
<p>I am tired of all this nonsense. Towards the latter part of
May I will come back to Chicago, and after a few day's stay would come
back to the East again. </p>
<p>I spoke last night at the Waldorf hotel. Mrs. Smith sold
tickets at $2 each. I had a full hall which by the way was a small one.
I have not seen anything of the money yet. Hope to see in the course of
the day. </p>
<p>I made a hundred dollars at Lynn which I do not send because I
have to make my new gown and other nonsense. </p>
<p>Do not expect to make any money at Boston. Still I must touch
the brain of America and stir it up if I can.&nbsp; </p>

You were perfectly right — I enjoyed the fun of the lunatic Interior, (Chicago Interior, a Presbyterian newspaper which opposed Swamiji. — Ed.) but the mail you sent yesterday from India was really, as Mother Church says in her letter, a good news after a long interval. There is a beautiful letter from Dewanji. The old man — Lord bless him — offers as usual to help me. Then there was a little pamphlet published in Calcutta about me — revealing that once at least in my life the prophet has been honoured in his own country. There are extracts from American and Indian papers and magazines about me. The extracts printed from Calcutta papers were especially gratifying, although the strain is so fulsome that I refuse to send the pamphlet over to you. They call me illustrious, wonderful, and all sorts of nonsense, but they forward me the gratitude of the whole nation. Now I do not care what they even of my own people say about me — except for one thing. I have an old mother. She has suffered much all her life and in the midst of all she could bear to give me up for the service of God and man; but to have given up the most beloved of her children — her hope — to live a beastly immoral life in a far distant country, as Mazoomdar was telling in Calcutta, would have simply killed her. But the Lord is great, none can injure His children.

The cat is out of the bag — without my seeking at all. And who do you think is the editor of one of our leading papers which praise me so much and thankGod that I came to America to represent Hinduism? Mazoomdar's cousin!! — Poor Mazoomdar — he has injured his cause by telling lies through jealousy. Lord knows I never attempted any defence.

I read the article of Mr. Gandhi in theForumbefore this.

If you have got theReview of Reviewsof last month — read to mother the testimony about the Hindus in connection with the opium question in India by one of the highest officials of the English in India. He compares the English with the Hindus and lauds the Hindu to the skies. Sir Lepel Griffin was one of the bitterest enemies of our race. What made this change of front?

I had a very good time in Boston at Mrs. Breed's — and saw Prof. Wright. I am going to Boston again. The tailor is making my new gown. I am going to speak at Cambridge University [Harvard] and would be the guest of Prof. Wright there. They write grand welcomes to me in the Boston papers.

I am tired of all this nonsense. Towards the latter part of May I will come back to Chicago, and after a few day's stay would come back to the East again.

I spoke last night at the Waldorf hotel. Mrs. Smith sold tickets at $2 each. I had a full hall which by the way was a small one. I have not seen anything of the money yet. Hope to see in the course of the day.

I made a hundred dollars at Lynn which I do not send because I have to make my new gown and other nonsense.

Do not expect to make any money at Boston. Still I must touch the brain of America and stir it up if I can.","Your loving brother,

<p>DEAR SISTER (Miss Isabelle McKindley.), </p>
<p>I am afraid I cannot send you the pamphlet just now. But I got
a little bit of a newspaper cutting from India yesterday which I send
you up. After you have read it kindly send it over to Mrs. Bagley. The
editor of this paper is a relative of Mr. Mazoomdar. I am now sorry for
poor Mazoomdar!! (The last two sentences were written crosswise on the
left margin.) </p>
<p>I could not find the exact orange colour of my coat here, so I
have been obliged to satisfy myself with the next best &#8212; a cardinal red

<p>The coat will be ready in a few days. </p>
<p>Got about $70 the other day by lecturing at Waldorf. And hope
to get some more by tomorrow's lecture. </p>
<p>From 7th to 19th there are engagements in Boston, but they pay
very little. </p>
<p>Yesterday I bought a pipe for $13 &#8212; meerschaum do not tell it

the coming lecture. </p>

dinner! Well, I am a vegetarian . . ., because I prefer it when I can
get it. I have another invitation to lunch with Lyman Abbott day after
tomorrow. After all, I am having very nice time and hope to have very
nice time in Boston &#8212; only that nasty nasty lecturing &#8212; disgusting.
However as soon as 19th is over &#8212; one leap from Boston . . . to Chicago
. . . and then I will have a long<!--'Volume 7 Page 465'-->

<p>I am going to speak to the students of the Harvard University.
Three lectures at Boston, three at Harvard &#8212; all arranged by Mrs.

<p>DEAR ADHYAPAKJI (Prof. John Henry Wright), </p>
<p>By this time you have got the pamphlet and the letters. If you
like, I would send you over from Chicago some letters from Indian
Princes and ministers &#8212; one of these ministers was one of the
Commissioners of the late opium commission that sat under Royal
Commission in India. If you like, I will have them write to you to
convince you of my not being a cheat. But, my brother, our ideal of
life is to hide, to suppress, and to deny. </p>
<p>We are to give up and not to take. Had I not the ""Fad"" in my
head, I would never have come over here. And it was with a hope that it
would help my cause that I joined the Parliament of Religions &#8212; having
always refused it when our people wanted to send me for it. I came over
telling them &#8212; ""that I may or may not join that assembly &#8212; and you may
send me over if you like"". They sent me over leaving me quite free. </p>
<p>You did the rest. </p>
<p>I am morally bound to afford you every satisfaction, my kind
friend; but for the rest of the world I do not care what they say &#8212; the
Sannyasin must not have self-defence. So I beg of you not to publish or
show anybody anything in that pamphlet or the letters. I do not care
for the attempts of the old missionary; but the fever of jealousy which
attacked Mazoomdar gave me a terrible shock, and I pray that he would
know better &#8212; for he is a great and good man who has tried all his life
to do good. But this proves one of my Master's sayings, ""Living in a
room covered with black soot &#8212; however<!--'Volume 7 Page 467'-->
careful you may be &#8212; some spots must stick to your clothes."" So,
however one may try to be good and holy, so long he is in the world,
some part of his nature must gravitate downwards. </p>
<p>The way to God is the opposite to that of the world. And to
few, very few, are given to have God and mammon at the same time. </p>
<p>I was never a <i>missionary</i>, nor ever would
be one &#8212; my place is in the Himalayas. I have satisfied myself so far
that I can with a full conscience say, ""My God, I saw terrible misery
amongst my brethren; I searched and discovered the way out of it, tried
my best to apply the remedy, but failed. So Thy will be done."" </p>

<i>5th September, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. BHATTACHARYA (Mr. Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya),</p>
<p>I was much pleased to read your affectionate letter. I shall
make inquiries about the weaving machine as soon as I can, and let you
know. Now I am resting at Annisquam, a village on the seacoast; soon I
shall go to the city and attend to the matter of the machine. These
seaside places are filled with people during the summer; some come to
bathe in the sea, some to take rest, and some to catch husbands. </p>
<p>There is a strong sense of decorum in this country. </p>
<p>You have to keep yourself always covered from neck to foot in
the presence of women. You cannot so much as mention the normal
functions of the body: nobody knows when anyone goes to the toilet &#8212;
one has to live so circumspectly. In this country, you can blow your
nose a thousand times into your handkerchief &#8212; there<!--'Volume 7 Page 471'-->
is no harm in that; but it is highly uncivilised to belch. Women
sometimes are not embarrassed to expose their bodies above the waist &#8212;
you must have seen the kind of low-cut gown they wear &#8212; but they say
that to go bare-foot is as bad as being naked. Just as we always dwell
on the soul, so they take care of the body, and there is no end to the
cleaning and embellishing of it. One who fails to do this has no place
in society. </p>
<p>Our method of cooking with cow-dung fuel and eating on the
floor they consider eating like pigs: they say that the Hindus have no
sense of disgust and that, like pigs, they eat cow-dung. The word
""cow-dung"" is taboo in English. On the other hand, numbers of people
will drink water with the same glass without thinking of washing it,
and they rarely observe the rule that things must be washed before
cooking. But should the clothes of the cook be a little soiled, they
will throw her out. The table-ware is all spick and span. They are the
richest people on earth; their enjoyments and luxuries beggar
description. </p>
<p>In Rajputana they imitate the Mohammedans in their mode of
dining, which is, on the whole, good. They sit on a low seat and place
their plate of rice on a low table. This is much better than spreading
a banana leaf on the earthen floor plastered with cow-dung and filth.
And how disastrous if the leaf gets torn! The Hindus did not know much
about clothes or food. Moreover, whatever Hindu civilisation there was
existed in the Punjab and the north-west provinces. . . . </p>
<p>Our women lose caste if they put on shoes, but the Rajput
women lose their caste if they don't put on shoes! Says Manu: ""One
shall always wear shoes"". There is no denying that people should have a
decent enough standard of living. I say they should be neat and clean
even though not luxurious. . . . I say, why do we have to be
Englishmen? It is enough for the present if we<!--'Volume 7 Page 472'-->
imitate our brothers of the western provinces. If group after group of
Indians travel all over the world and back for some years, the face of
India will be changed within twenty years by that alone; nothing else
need be done. But how will anything happen if the people of one village
do not visit the next? However, everything will take place by and by.
By and by, the stubborn Bengali boys will awaken the country. But
Manmatha Babu, you will have to stop this shameful business of marrying
off nine-year-old girls. That is the root of all sins. It is a very
great sin, my boy. Consider further what a terrible thing it was that
when the government wanted to pass a law stopping early marriage, our
worthless people raised a tremendous howl! If we don't stop it
ourselves, the government will naturally intervene, and that is just
what it wants to do. All the world cries fie upon us. You remain shut
up in your homes, but the people outside spit upon you. How far can I
quarrel with them? What a horror &#8212; even a father and mother allow their
ten-year-old daughter to be given in marriage to a full-grown fat
husband! O Lord, is there any punishment unless there has been a sin?
It is all the fruit of Karma. If ours were not a terribly sinful
nation, then why should it have been booted and beaten for seven
hundred years? </p>
<p>Now, just as in our country the parents suffer a lot to have
their daughter married, here in the same way the girls suffer &#8212; the
parents only a little &#8212; it is the job of the girls to capture husbands.
I am now closely associated with them in all their affairs; I am, as it
were, a woman amongst women. Therefore, I have seen, and am seeing, all
their play. To give dinners, to dance, to go to musical parties, go to
the watering places &#8212; all that is all right. But all the while the
young women are scheming within themselves how to capture husbands.
They hang round the boys. The boys, on the other hand, are so cautious
that, though they mingle with the<!--'Volume 7 Page 473'-->
girls and flirt with them all the time, when it is time to surrender
they run away. The boys place the girls above themselves; they show
them respect and slave for them; but the moment the girls stretch their
hands to catch them, they run away beyond their reach. After many
efforts of this kind, a girl succeeds in capturing a boy. If the girl
has money, then many a boy dances attendance upon her, but the poor
have great difficulty. If a poor girl is exceedingly beautiful, she can
marry quickly; otherwise, she has to wait all her life. Just as in our
country, so here, one marriage in a thousand takes place through love
and courtship; the rest are based on money. After that, quarrel, and
then, 'Get out!' &#8212; divorce. We do not have this; the only way out is to
hang oneself. It is the same in all countries. Only, here the girls
take matters into their own hands; and in our country, we get the help
of the parents to give their married life a decent appearance. The
result is the same in either case. </p>
<p>Nowadays, however, American girls don't want to marry. During
the Civil War a large number of men were killed and women began to do
all kinds of work. Since then, they have not wanted to give up the
rights they have acquired. They earn their own living, and therefore
they say, ""There is no use in marrying. If we truly fall in love, then
we shall marry; otherwise, we shall earn and meet our own expenses"".
Even if the father is a millionaire, the son has to earn enough before
he marries. One may not marry depending on an allowance from the
father. The girls also want the same thing now. When a son marries he
becomes like a stranger to his own family, but when a girl marries she
brings her husband, as it were, into her parents' home. Men will visit
their wives' parents ten times, but rarely go to their own parents. Yet
they are very much afraid of having their mothers-in-law on their neck.
</p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 474'-->
<p>In this country, there are rivers of wealth and waves of
beauty, and an abundance of knowledge everywhere. The country is very
healthy; they know how to enjoy this earth. . . . When princes of
Europe become poor they come to marry here. The average American
doesn't like this; but some rich, beautiful women fall for the titles.
Yet it is very difficult for American women to live in Europe. The
husbands of this country are slaves of their wives; but the European
wives are slaves to their husbands &#8212; this the American women don't
like. In everything, the men here have to say, 'Yes dear'; otherwise
the wives lose face before people. </p>
<p>The women in America are very sentimental and have a mania for
romance. I am, however, a strange sort of animal who hasn't any
romantic feeling, and therefore they could not sustain any such feeling
toward me and they show me great respect. I make all of them call me
""father"" or ""brother"". I don't allow them to come near me with any
other feeling, and gradually they have all been straightened out. . . .
</p>
<p>The ministers in this country . . . are eager to throw sinners
into hell. A few of them are very good, however. . . . I have a great
reputation among the women in this country. I have not as yet seen a
single unchaste girl among the unmarried. It is either a widow or a
married woman who turn unchaste. The unmarried girls are exceedingly
good, because their future is bright. . . . </p>
<p>Those emaciated Western women, looking like old dried-up
fruit, whom you see in India, are English, and the English are an ugly
race amongst the Europeans. In America, the best blood strains of
Europe have been blended, and therefore, the American women are very
beautiful. And how they take care of their beauty! Can a woman retain
her beauty if she gives birth to children . . . every hour from her
tenth year on? Damn nonsense! What<!--'Volume 7 Page 475'-->
a terrible sin! Even the most beautiful woman of our country will look
like a black owl here. Yet it must be admitted that the women of the
Punjab have very well-drawn features. Many of the American women are
very well educated and put many a learned professor to shame; nor do
they care for anyone's opinion. And as regards their virtues: what
kindness, what noble thought and action! Just think, if a man of this
country were to visit India, nobody would even touch him; yet here I am
allowed to do as I please in the houses of the best families &#8212; like
their own son! I am like a child; their women shop for me, run errands
for me. For example: I have just written to a girl for information
about the machine, which she will gather carefully and send to me.
Again, a phonograph was sent to the Maharaj of Khetri: the girls
managed the whole affair very well. Lord! Lord! It is the difference
between heaven and hell! ""They are the goddess Lakshmi in beauty and
the goddess Saraswati in talents and accomplishments."" This cannot be
achieved through the study of books. I say, can you send out some men
and women to see the world? Only then will the country wake up &#8212; not
through the reading of books. The men here are very clever in earning
wealth. Where others do not see even dust, there they see gold. Whoever
will leave India and visit another country will earn great merit. </p>
<p>Keeping aloof from the community of nations is the only cause
for the downfall of India. Since the English came, they have been
forcing you back into communion with other nations, and you are visibly
rising again. Everyone that comes out of the country confers a benefit
on the whole nation; for it is by doing that alone that your horizon
will expand. And as women cannot avail themselves of this advantage,
they have made almost no progress in India. There is no station of
rest; either you progress upwards or you go back and die out. The only<!--'Volume 7 Page 476'-->
sign of life is going outward and forward and expansion. Contraction is
death. Why should you do good to others? Because that is the only
condition of life; thereby you expand beyond your little self; you live
and grow. All narrowness, all contraction, all selfishness is simply
slow suicide, and when a nation commits the fatal mistake of
contracting itself and of thus cutting off all expansion and life, it
must die. Women similarly must go forward or become idiots and soulless
tools in the hands of their tyrannical lords. The children are the
result of the combination of the tyrant and the idiot, and they are <i>slaves</i>.
And this is the whole history of modern India. Oh, who would break this
horrible crystallisation of death? Lord help us! (This paragraph was
written in English.) </p>
<p>Gradually all this will come about: ""One should cross a road
slowly and cautiously; one should patch a quilt carefully and
cautiously; so should one be slow and cautious in crossing a mountain"".
</p>
<p>The papers have arrived duly and in good shape; there has not
been any difficulty about that. The enemy has been silenced. Consider
this: They have allowed me, an unknown young man, to live among their
grown-up young daughters, and when my own countryman, Mazoomdar, says I
am a rogue, they don't pay any attention! How noble they are, and how
kind! I shall not be able to repay this debt even in a hundred lives, I
am like a foster son to the American women; they are really my mother.
If they don't flourish in every way, who would? </p>
<p>A while back several hundred intellectual men and women were
gathered in a place called Greenacre, and I was there for nearly two
months. Every day I would sit in our Hindu fashion under a tree, and my
followers and disciples would sit on the grass all around me. Every<!--'Volume 7 Page 477'-->
morning I would instruct them, and how earnest they were! </p>
<p>The whole country now knows me. The ministers are very angry;
but, naturally, not all of them. There are many followers of mine
amongst the learned ministers of this country. The ignorant and the
stubborn amongst them don't understand anything but only make trouble,
and thereby they only hurt themselves. But abusing me, Mazoomdar has
lost three-fourths of what little popularity he had in this country. I
have been adopted by them. When anyone abuses me he is condemned
everywhere by the women. </p>
<p>I cannot say when I shall return to India, possibly next
winter. There I shall have to wander, and here also I do the same. </p>
<p>There is nothing more to add. Please don't make this letter
public. You understand, I have to be careful about every word I say &#8212; I
am now a public man. Everybody is watching, particularly the
clergy.&nbsp; </p>

DEAR MR. BHATTACHARYA (Mr. Manmatha Nath Bhattacharya),

I was much pleased to read your affectionate letter. I shall make inquiries about the weaving machine as soon as I can, and let you know.

<p>DEAR KALI [ABHEDANANDA], </p>
<p>Thanks for all that I come to know from your letter. I had no
news of the telegram in question having appeared in the <i>Tribune</i>.
It is six months since I left Chicago, and I have not been yet free to
return. So I could not keep myself well posted. You have taken great
pains indeed! And for this how can I thank you adequately? You have all
evinced a wonderful capacity for work. And how can Shri Ramakrishna's<!--'Volume 7 Page 478'-->
words prove false? &#8212; You have got wonderful spirit in you.
About Shashi Sanyal, I have already written. Nothing remains
undetected, through the grace of Shri Ramakrishna. But let him found a
sect or whatever he will, what harm? ""&#2358;&#2367;&#2357;&#2366; &#2357;&#2307; &#2360;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2369; &#2346;&#2344;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;&#2307; &#8212; May
blessings attend your
path!"" Secondly, I could not catch the drift of your letter. I shall
collect my own funds to build a monastery for ourselves, and if people
criticise me for it, I see nothing in this to affect us either way. You
have your minds pitched high and steady, it will do you no harm. May
you have exceeding love for one another among yourselves, and it would
be enough to have an attitude of indifference towards public
criticisms. Kalikrishna Babu has deep love for the cause and is a great
man. Please convey my special love to him. So long as there is no
feeling of disunion amongst you, through the grace of the Lord, I
assure you, there is no danger for you, ""&#2352;&#2339;&#2375; &#2357;&#2344;&#2375; &#2346;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2340;&#2350;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2325;&#2375; &#2357;&#2366; &#8212; be it
in battle, in the
forest, or on the top of mountains"". ""&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375;&#2351;&#2366;&#2306;&#2360;&#2367; &#2348;&#2361;&#2369;&#2357;&#2367;&#2328;&#2381;&#2344;&#2366;&#2344;&#2367; &#8212; All noble
undertakings are
fraught with obstacles"". It is quite in the nature of things. Keep up
the deepest mental poise. Take not even the slightest notice of what
puerile creatures may be saying against you. Indifference,
indifference, indifference! I have already written to Shashi
(Ramakrishnananda) in detail. Please do not send newspapers and tracts
any more. ""Take the husking hammer to heaven, and there it will do its
husking"", as the Bengali saying goes. The same trudging about here as
it was in India, only with the carrying of others' loads added! How can
I procure customers for people's books in this land? I am only one
amongst the many here and nothing more. Whatever the papers and things
of that sort in this country write about me, I make an offering of to
the Fire-God. You also do the same. That is the proper course. </p>
<p>A bit of public demonstration was necessary for Guru
Maharaja's work. It is done, and so far so good. Now<!--'Volume 7 Page 479'-->
you must on no account pay any heed to what the rabble may be prattling
about us. Whether I make my pile or do whatever else I am reported to,
shall the opinions of the riff-raff stand in the way of His work? My
dear brother, you are yet a boy, while I am growing grey. What regard I
have for the pronouncements and opinions of such people, you should
guess from this. So long as you gird up your loins and rally behind me,
there is no fear even if the whole world combine against us. This much
I understand that I shall have to take up a very lofty attitude, I
should not, I think, write to anyone except to you. By the by, where is
Gunanidhi? Try to find him out and bring him to the Math with all
kindness. He is a very sincere man and highly learned. You must try
your best to secure two plots of land, let people say what they will.
Let anyone write anything for or against me in the papers; you
shouldn't take the slightest notice. And my dear brother, I beseech you
repeatedly not to send me any more newspapers by the basketful. How can
you talk of rest now? We shall have rest awhile only when we give up
this body. Just do once get up the celebration, brother, in that
spirit, so that all the country around may burn with enthusiasm. Bravo!
Capital indeed! The whole band of scoffers will be swept away by the
tidal wave of love. You are elephants, forsooth, what do you fear from
an ant-bite? </p>
<p>The address (The Address presented by the citizens of Calcutta
who gathered at a meeting at the Town Hall on September 5, 1894, under
the Presidentship of Raja Pyari Mohan Mookherjee.) you sent me reached
me long ago and the reply to it has also been despatched to Pyari Babu
(18 Nov. 1894). </p>
<p>Bear in mind &#8212; the eyes are two in number and so<!--'Volume 7 Page 480'-->
the ears, but the mouth is but one! Indifference, indifference,
indifference! ""&#2344; &#2361;&#2367; &#2325;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2339;&#2325;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2325;&#2358;&#2381;&#2330;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2342;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2327;&#2340;&#2367;&#2306; &#2340;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381; &#2327;&#2330;&#2381;&#2331;&#2340;&#2367;
&#8212; The doer of good deeds never comes to grief, my dear"". Ah! To fear!
and whom are we going to fear, brother? Here the missionaries and their
ilk have howled themselves into silence &#8212; and the whole world will but
do likewise. </p>

the Goddess of Fortune favours or goes her way, whether death befalls

</p>
<p>You need not even mix with the humdrub people, nor beg of them
either. The Lord is supplying everything and will do so in future. What
fear, my brother? All great undertakings are achieved through mighty
obstacles. &#2361;&#2375; &#2357;&#2368;&#2352;, &#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2369; &#2346;&#2380;&#2352;&#2369;&#2359;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2350;&#2344;&#2307; &#2313;&#2346;&#2375;&#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2367;&#2340;&#2357;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366; &#2332;&#2344;&#2366;&#2307; &#2360;&#2369;&#2325;&#2371;&#2346;&#2339;&#2366;&#2307;

&#8212; You valiant one, put forth your manly efforts; wretched
people under the grip of lust and gold deserve to be looked upon with
indifference. Now I have got a firm footing in this country, and
therefore need no assistance. But my one prayer to you all is that you
should apply to the service of the Lord that active impulse of
manliness which your eagerness to help me through brotherly love has
brought out in you. Do not open out your mind, unless you feel it will
be positively beneficial. Use agreeable and wholesome language towards
even the greatest enemy. The desire for fame,<!--'Volume 7 Page 480'-->
for riches, for enjoyment is quite natural to every mortal, dear
brother, and if that agrees well with serving both ways (i.e. serving
both God and mammon), why, all men would exhibit great zeal! It is only
the great saint who can work, making a mountain of an atom of virtue in
others and cherishing no desire but that of the good of the world &#8212;
""&#2346;&#2352;&#2327;&#2369;&#2339;&#2346;&#2352;&#2350;&#2366;&#2339;&#2370;&#2344;&#2381; &#2346;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2340;&#2368;&#2325;&#2371;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;, &#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2349;&#2369;&#2357;&#2344;&#2350;&#2369;&#2346;&#2325;&#2366;&#2352;&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2375;&#2339;&#2368;&#2349;&#2367;&#2307; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;&#2339;&#2351;&#2344;&#2381;&#2340;&#2307;"" etc.,
(Bhartrihari, <i>Nitishataka</i>,

Therefore let dullards whose intellect is steeped in ignorance
and who look upon the non-Self as all in all, play out their boyish
pranks. They will of themselves leave off the moment they find it too
hot. Let them try to spit upon the moon &#8212; it will but recoil upon
themselves. &#2358;&#2369;&#2349;&#2306; &#2349;&#2357;&#2340;&#2369; &#2340;&#2375;&#2359;&#2366;&#2350;&#2381;&nbsp;&#8212; Godspeed to them! If they have

anything substantial in them, who can bar their success? But if it be
only empty swagger due to jealousy, then all will be in vain. Haramohan
has sent rosaries. All right. But you should know that religion of the
type that obtains in our country does not go here. You must suit it to
the taste of the people. If you ask them to become Hindus, they will
all give you a wide berth and hate you, as we do the Christian
missionaries. They like some of the ideas of the Hindu scriptures &#8212;
that is all. Nothing more than that, you should know. The men, most of
them, do not trouble about religion and all that. The women are a
little interested &#8212; that is all, but no large doses of it! A few
thousands of people have faith in the Advaita doctrine. But they will
give you the go-by if you talk obscure mannerisms about sacred
writings, caste, or women. Everything proceeds slowly, by degrees.

<p>DEAR BROTHER SHIVANANDA, </p>
<p>Your letter just reached me. Perhaps by this time you have
received my other letters and learnt that it is not necessary to send
anything to America any more. Too much of everything is bad. This
newspaper booming has given me popularity no doubt, but its effect is
more in India than here. Here, on the other hand, constant booming
creates a distaste in the minds of the higher class people; so enough.
Now try to organise yourselves in India on the lines of these meetings.
You need not send anything more in this country. As to money, I have
determined first to build some place for Mother, (Holy Mother, Shri
Sarada Devi.) for women require it first. . . . I can send nearly Rs.
7,000 for a place for Mother. If the place is first secured, then I do
not care for anything else. I hope to be able to get Rs. 1,600 a year
from this country even when I am gone. That sum I will make over to the
support of the Women's place, and then it will grow. I have written to
you already to secure a place. . . . </p>
<p>I would have, before this, returned to India, but India has no
money. Thousands honour Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, but nobody will give a
cent &#8212; that is India. . . . In the meanwhile live in harmony at any
price. The world cares little for principles. They care for persons.
They will hear with patience the words of a man they like, however
nonsense, and will not listen to anyone they do not like. Think of this
and modify your conduct accordingly. Everything will come all right. Be
the servant if you will rule. That is the real secret. Your love will
tell even if your words be harsh. Instinctively<!--'Volume 7 Page 483'-->
men feel the love clothed in whatever language. (These two paragraphs
and the last half of the fourth were written in English.) </p>
<p>My dear brother, that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was God
incarnate, I have not the least doubt; but then you must let people
find out for themselves what he used to teach &#8212; you cannot thrust these
things upon them &#8212; this is my only objection. </p>
<p>Let people speak out their own opinions, why should we object?
Without studying Ramakrishna Paramahamsa first, one can never
understand the real import of the Vedas, the Vedanta, of the <i>Bhâgavata</i>
and the other Purânas. His life is a searchlight of infinite power
thrown upon the whole mass of Indian religious thought. He was the
living commentary to the Vedas and to their aim. He had lived in one
life the whole cycle of the national religious existence in India.</p>
<p>Whether Bhagavân Shri Krishna was born at all we are not sure;
and Avataras like Buddha and Chaitanya are monotonous; Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa is the latest and the most perfect &#8212; the concentrated
embodiment of knowledge, love, renunciation, catholicity, and the
desire to serve mankind. So where is anyone to compare with him? He
must have been born in vain who cannot appreciate him! My supreme good
fortune is that I am his servant through life after life. A single word
of his is to me far weightier than the Vedas and the Vedanta. &#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;
&#2342;&#2366;&#2360;&#2342;&#2366;&#2360;&#2342;&#2366;&#2360;&#2379;&#2365;&#2361;&#2350;&#2381;&nbsp;&#8212; Oh, I am the servant of the servants
of his servants. But narrow bigotry militates against his principles,

and his teachings bear fruit instead! Why, was he a slave to fame?
Certain fishermen and illiterate people called Jesus Christ a God, but
the literate people killed him. Buddha was honoured in his lifetime by
a number of merchants and cowherds. But Ramakrishna has been worshipped
in his<!--'Volume 7 Page 484'--> lifetime &#8212; towards the
end of this nineteenth century &#8212; by the demons and giants of the
university as God incarnate. . . . Only a few things have been jotted

Mother's life &#8212; none of you. But gradually you will know. Without
Shakti (Power) there is no regeneration for the world. Why is it that
our country is the weakest and the most backward of all countries? &#8212;
Because Shakti is held in dishonour there. Mother has been born to
revive that wonderful Shakti in India; and making her the nucleus, once
more will Gârgis and Maitreyis be born into the world. Dear brother,
you understand little now, but by degrees you will come to know it all.
Hence it is her Math that I want first. . . . Without the grace of
Shakti nothing is to be accomplished. What do I find in America and
Europe? &#8212; the worship of Shakti, the worship of Power. Yet they worship
Her ignorantly through sense-gratification. Imagine, then, what a lot
of good they will achieve who will worship Her with all purity, in a
Sattvika spirit, looking upon Her as their mother! I am coming to
understand things clearer every day, my insight is opening out more and
more. Hence we must first build a Math for Mother. First Mother and
Mother's daughters, then Father and Father's sons &#8212; can you understand
this? . . . To me, Mother's grace is a hundred thousand times more
valuable than Father's. Mother's grace, Mother's blessings are all
paramount to me. . . . Please pardon me. I am a little bigoted there,
as regards Mother. If but<!--'Volume 7 Page 485'--> Mother
orders, her demons can work anything. Brother, before proceeding to
America I wrote to Mother to bless me. Her blessings came, and at one
bound I cleared the ocean. There, you see. In this terrible winter I am
lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds
may be collected for Mother's Math. Baburam's mother must have lost her
sense owing to old age and that is why she is about to worship Durga in
the earthen image, ignoring the living one. (Viz. Holy Mother Shri
Sarada Devi.) Brother, faith is very difficult to achieve. Brother, I
shall show how to worship the living Durga and then only shall I be
worthy of my name. I shall be relieved when you will have purchased a
plot of land and established there the living Durga, the Mother. Till
then I am not returning to my native land. As soon as you can do that,
I shall have a sigh of relief after sending the money. Do you
accomplish this festival of Durga of mine by making all the necessary
arrangements. Girish Ghosh is adoring the Mother splendidly; blessed is
he, and blessed are his followers. Brother, often enough, when I am
reminded of the Mother, I ejaculate, ""What after all is Rama?"" Brother,
that is where my fanaticism lies, I tell you. Of Ramakrishna, you may
aver, my brother, that he was an Incarnation or whatever else you may
like but fie on him who has no devotion for the Mother. Niranjan has a
militant disposition, but he has great devotion for Mother and all his
vagaries I can easily put up with. He is now doing the most marvellous
work. I am keeping myself well posted. And you too have done
excellently in co-operating with the Madrasis. Dear brother, I expect
much from you, you should organise all for conjoint work. As soon as
you have secured the land for Mother, I go to India straight. It must
be a big plot; let there be a mud-house to begin with, in due course I

</body></html>",9289,"DEAR BROTHER SHIVANANDA,

Your letter just reached me. Perhaps by this time you have received my other letters and learnt that it is not necessary to send anything to America any more. Too much of everything is bad. This newspaper booming has given me popularity no doubt, but its effect is more in India than here. Here, on the other hand, constant booming creates a distaste in the minds of the higher class people; so enough. Now try to organise yourselves in India on the lines of these meetings. You need not send anything more in this country. As to money, I have determined first to build some place for Mother, (Holy Mother, Shri Sarada Devi.) for women require it first. . . . I can send nearly Rs. 7,000 for a place for Mother. If the place is first secured, then I do not care for anything else. I hope to be able to get Rs. 1,600 a year from this country even when I am gone. That sum I will make over to the support of the Women's place, and then it will grow. I have written to you already to secure a place. . . .

I would have, before this, returned to India, but India has no money. Thousands honour Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, but nobody will give a cent — that is India. . . . In the meanwhile live in harmony at any price. The world cares little for principles. They care for persons. They will hear with patience the words of a man they like, however nonsense, and will not listen to anyone they do not like. Think of this and modify your conduct accordingly. Everything will come all right. Be the servant if you will rule. That is the real secret. Your love will tell even if your words be harsh. Instinctivelymen feel the love clothed in whatever language. (These two paragraphs and the last half of the fourth were written in English.)

My dear brother, that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was God incarnate, I have not the least doubt; but then you must let people find out for themselves what he used to teach — you cannot thrust these things upon them — this is my only objection.

Let people speak out their own opinions, why should we object? Without studying Ramakrishna Paramahamsa first, one can never understand the real import of the Vedas, the Vedanta, of theBhâgavataand the other Purânas. His life is a searchlight of infinite power thrown upon the whole mass of Indian religious thought. He was the living commentary to the Vedas and to their aim. He had lived in one life the whole cycle of the national religious existence in India.

Whether Bhagavân Shri Krishna was born at all we are not sure; and Avataras like Buddha and Chaitanya are monotonous; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is the latest and the most perfect — the concentrated embodiment of knowledge, love, renunciation, catholicity, and the desire to serve mankind. So where is anyone to compare with him? He must have been born in vain who cannot appreciate him! My supreme good fortune is that I am his servant through life after life. A single word of his is to me far weightier than the Vedas and the Vedanta. तस्य दासदासदासोऽहम् — Oh, I am the servant of the servants of his servants. But narrow bigotry militates against his principles, and this makes me cross. Rather let his name be drowned in oblivion, and his teachings bear fruit instead! Why, was he a slave to fame? Certain fishermen and illiterate people called Jesus Christ a God, but the literate people killed him. Buddha was honoured in his lifetime by a number of merchants and cowherds. But Ramakrishna has been worshipped in hislifetime — towards the end of this nineteenth century — by the demons and giants of the university as God incarnate. . . .

<p>DEAR ALASINGA, </p>
<p>Last week I wrote you about the <i>Brahmavâdin</i>.
I forgot to write about the Bhakti lectures. They ought to be published
in a book all together. A few hundreds may be sent to America to
Goodyear in New York. Within twenty days I sail for England. I have
other big books on Karma, Jnana, and Raja Yogas &#8212; the Karma is out
already, the Raja will be a very big book and is already in the Press.
The Jnana will have to be published, I think, in England. </p>
<p>A letter you published from Kripananda in the <i>Brahmavadin</i>
was rather unfortunate. Kripananda is smarting under the blows the
Christians have given him and that sort of letter is vulgar, pitching
into everybody. It is not in accord with the tone of the <i>Brahmavadin</i>.
So in future when Kripananda writes, tone down everything that is an
attack upon any sect, however cranky or crude. Nothing which is against
any sect, good or bad, should get into the <i>Brahmavadin</i>.
Of course, we must not show active sympathy with frauds. Again let me
remind you that the paper is too technical to find any subscriber here.
The average Western neither knows nor cares to know all about
jaw-breaking Sanskrit terms and technicalities. The paper is well
fitted for India &#8212; that I see. Every word of special pleading should be
<!--'Volume 7 Page 491'-->eliminated from the Editorials,

<p class=""right"">HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, <br>
READING, <br>
<i>27th April, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR (Members of the Alambazar Math), </p>
<p>. . . Let me write something for you all. It is not for
gaining personal authority that I do this, but for your good and for
fulfilling the purpose for which the Lord came. He gave me the charge
of you all, and you shall contribute to the great well-being of the
world &#8212; though most of you are not yet aware of it &#8212; this is the
special reason of my writing to you. It will be a great pity if any
feeling of jealousy or egotism gain ground amongst you. Is it possible
for those to establish cordial relations on earth who cannot cordially
live with one another for any length of time? No doubt it is an evil to
be bound by laws, but it is necessary at the immature stage to be
guided by rules; in other words, as the Master used to say that the
sapling must be hedged round, and so on. Secondly, it is quite natural
for idle minds to indulge in gossip, and faction-mongering, and so
forth. Hence I jot down the following hints. If you follow them, you
will undoubtedly prosper, but if you don't do<!--'Volume 7 Page 492'-->
so, then there is a danger of all our labours coming to naught. </p>
<p>First let me write about the management of the Math: </p>
<p>1. For the purposes of the Math please hire a commodious house
or garden, where everyone may have a small room to himself. There must
be a spacious hall where the books may be kept, and a smaller room for
meeting the visitors. If possible, there should be another big hall in
the house where study of the scriptures and religious discourses will
be held every day for the public. </p>
<p>2. Anyone wishing to visit anybody in the Math should see him
only and depart, without troubling others. </p>
<p>3. By turns someone should be present in the hall for a few
hours every day for the public, so that they may get satisfactory
replies to what they come to ask. </p>
<p>4. Everyone must keep to his room and except on special
business must not go to others' rooms. Anyone who wishes may go to the
Library and read, but it should be strictly forbidden to smoke there or
talk with others. The reading should be silent. </p>
<p>5. It shall be wholly forbidden to huddle together in a room
and chat the whole day away, with any number of outsiders coming and
joining in the hubbub. </p>
<p>6. Only those that are seekers after religion may come and
peacefully wait in the Visitors' Hall and when they have seen the
particular persons they want, they should depart. Or, if they have any
general question to ask, they should refer to the person in charge of
that function for the day and leave. </p>
<p>7. Tale-bearing, caballing, or reporting scandals about others
should be altogether eschewed. </p>
<p>8. A small room should serve as the office. The Secretary
should live in that room, which should contain paper, ink, and other
materials for letter-writing. He<!--'Volume 7 Page 493'-->
should keep an account of the income and expenditure. All
correspondence should come to him, and he should deliver all letters <i>unopened</i>
to their addressees. Books and pamphlets should be sent to the Library.
</p>
<p>9. There will be a small room for smoking, which should not be
indulged in outside this room. </p>
<p>10. He who wants to indulge in invectives or show temper must
do so outside the boundaries of the Math. This should not be deviated
from even by an inch.</p>
<p class=""center"">THE GOVERNING BODY</p>
<p>1. Every year a President should be elected by a majority of
votes. The next year, another, and so on. </p>
<p>2. For this year make Brahmananda the President and likewise
make another the Secretary, and elect a third man for superintending
the worship etc., as well as the arrangement of food. </p>
<p>3. The Secretary shall have another function, viz to keep
watch over the general health. Regarding this I have three instructions
to give: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>i</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In every room for each man there shall be a <i>Nair</i>
charpoy, mattress, etc. Everyone must keep his room clean. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>ii</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All arrangements must be made to provide clear and pure water for
drinking and cooking purposes, for it is a deadly sin to cook
sacramental food in impure or unclean water. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>iii</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;
Give everyone two ochre cloaks of the type that you have made for
Saradananda, and see that clothing is kept clean. </p>
<p>4. Anyone wishing to be a Sannyâsin should be admitted as a
Brahmacharin first. He should live one year at the Math and one year
outside, after which he may be initiated into Sannyâsa. </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 494'-->
<p>5. Make over charge of the worship to one of these
Brahmacharins, and change them now and then.</p>
<p class=""center"">DEPARTMENTS</p>
<p>There shall be the following departments in the Math: </p>
<p>I. <i>Study</i>. II. <i>Propaganda</i>.
III. <i>Religious Practice</i>. </p>
<p>I. <i>Study</i>&nbsp; &#8212; The object of this
department is to provide books and teachers for those who want to
study. Every morning and evening the teachers should be ready for them.
</p>
<p>II. <i>Propaganda</i> &#8212; Within the Math, and
abroad. The preachers in the Math should teach the inquirers by reading
out scriptures to them and by means of question-classes. The preachers
abroad will preach from village to village and try to start Maths like
the above in different places. </p>
<p>III. <i>Religious Practice</i> &#8212; This department
will try to provide those who want to practise with the requisites for
this. But it should not be allowed that because one has taken to
religious practice he will prevent others from study or preaching. Any
one infringing this rule shall be immediately asked to clear out, and
this is imperative. </p>
<p>The preachers at home should give lessons on devotion,
knowledge, Yoga, and work by turns; for this, the days and hours should
be fixed, and the routine hung up at the door of the class-room. That
is to say, a seeker after devotion may not present himself on the day
fixed for knowledge and feel wounded thereby; and so on. </p>
<p>None of you are fit for the Vâmâchâra form of practice.
Therefore this should on no account be practised at the Math. Anyone
demurring to this must step out of this Order. This form of practice
must never even be mentioned in the Math. Ruin shall seize the wicked
man, both here and hereafter, who would introduce vile Vamachara into
His fold! </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 495'-->
<p class=""center"">SOME GENERAL REMARKS</p>
<p>1. If any woman comes to have a talk with a Sannyasin, she
should do it in the Visitors' Hall. No woman shall be allowed to enter
any other room &#8212; except the Worship-room. </p>
<p>2. No Sannyasin shall be allowed to reside in the Women's
Math. Anyone refusing to obey this rule shall be expelled from the
Math. ""Better an empty fold than a wicked herd."" </p>
<p>3. Men of evil character shall be rigorously kept out. On no
pretence shall their shadow even cross the threshold of my room. If
anyone amongst you become wicked, turn him out at once, whoever he be.
We want no black sheep. The Lord will bring lots of good people. </p>
<p>4. Any woman can come to the class-room (or preaching hall)
during class time or preaching hour, but must leave the place directly
when that period is over. </p>
<p>5. Never show temper, or harbour jealousy, or backbite another
in secret. It would be the height of cruelty and hard-heartedness to
take note of others' shortcoming instead of rectifying one's own. </p>
<p>6. There should be fixed hours of meals. Everyone must have a
seat and a low dining table. He will sit on the former and put his
plate on the latter, as is the custom in Rajputana.</p>
<p class=""center"">THE OFFICE-BEARERS</p>
<p>All the office-bearers you should elect by ballot, as was the
mandate of Lord Buddha. That is to say, one should propose that such
and such should be the President this year; and all should write on
bits of paper 'yes' or 'no' and put them in a pitcher. If the 'yes'
have a majority, he should be elected President, and so on. Though you
should elect office-bearers in this way, yet I<!--'Volume 7 Page 496'-->
suggest that this year Brahmananda should be President, Nirmalananda,
Secretary and Treasurer, Sadananda Librarian, and Ramakrishnananda,
Abhedananda, Turiyananda, and Trigunatitananda should take charge of
the teaching and preaching work by turns, and so on. </p>
<p>It is no doubt a good idea that Trigunatita has of starting a
magazine. But I shall consent to it if only you can work jointly. </p>
<p>About doctrines and so forth I have to say only this, that if
anyone accepts Paramahamsa Deva as Avatâra etc., it is all right; if he
doesn't do so, it is just the same. The truth about it is that in point
of character, Paramahamsa Deva beats all previous records; and as
regards teaching, he was more liberal, more original, and more
progressive than all his predecessors. In other words, the older
Teachers were rather one-sided, while the teaching of this new
Incarnation or Teacher is that the best point of Yoga, devotion,
knowledge, and work must be combined now so as to form a new society. .
. . The older ones were no doubt good, but this is the new religion of
this age &#8212; the synthesis of Yoga, knowledge, devotion, and work &#8212; the
propagation of knowledge and devotion to all, down to the very lowest,
without distinction of age or sex. The previous Incarnations were all
right, but they have been synthesised in the person of Ramakrishna. For
the ordinary man and the beginner, steady devotion (Nishthâ) to an
ideal is of paramount importance. That is to say, teach them that all
great Personalities should be duly honoured, but homage should be paid
now to Ramakrishna. There can be no vigour without steady devotion.
Without it one cannot preach with the intensity of a Mahâvira
(Hanumân). Besides, the previous ones have become rather old. Now we
have a new India, with its new God, new religion, and new Vedas. When,
O Lord, shall our land be free from this eternal dwelling upon the
past? Well, a little bigotry also<!--'Volume 7 Page 497'-->
is a necessity. But we must harbour no antagonistic feelings towards
others. </p>
<p>If you consider it wise to be guided by my ideas and if you
follow these rules, then I shall supply on all necessary funds. . . .
Moreover, please show this letter to Gour-Mâ, Yogin-Mâ, and others, and
through them establish a Women's Math. Let Gour-Ma be the President
there for one year, and so on. But none of you shall be allowed to
visit the place. They will manage their own affairs. They will not have
to work at your dictation. I shall supply all necessary expenses for
that work also. </p>
<p>May the Lord guide you in the right direction! Two persons
went to see the Lord Jagannatha. One of them beheld the Deity &#8212; while
the other saw some trash that was haunting his mind! My friends, many
have no doubt served the Master, but whenever anyone would be disposed
to consider himself an extraordinary personage, he should think that
although he was associated with Shri Ramakrishna, he has seen only the
trash that was uppermost in his mind! Were it not so, he would manifest
the results. The Master himself used to quote, ""They would sing and
dance in the name of the Lord but come to grief in the end."" The root
of that degeneration is egotism &#8212; to think that one is just as great as
any other, indeed! ""He used to love me too!"" &#8212; one would plead. Alas,
Nick Bottom, would you then be thus translated? Would such a man envy
or quarrel with another and degrade himself? Bear in mind that through
His grace lots of men will be turned out with the nobility of gods &#8212;
ay, wherever His mercy would drop! . . . Obedience is the first duty.
Well, just do with alacrity what I ask you to. Let me see how you carry
out these few small things. Then gradually great things will come to
pass.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours,</p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 498'-->
<p><br>
PS. Please read the contents of this letter to all, and let me know
whether you consider the suggestions worth carrying out. Please tell
Brahmananda that he who is the servant of all is their true master. He
never becomes a leader in whose love there is a consideration of high
or low. He whose love knows no end, and never stops to consider high or
low, has the whole world lying at his feet.</p>

There shall be the following departments in the Math:

I.Study. II.Propaganda. III.Religious Practice.

I.Study— The object of this department is to provide books and teachers for those who want to study. Every morning and evening the teachers should be ready for them.

II.Propaganda— Within the Math, and abroad. The preachers in the Math should teach the inquirers by reading out scriptures to them and by means of question-classes. The preachers abroad will preach from village to village and try to start Maths like the above in different places.

III.Religious Practice— This department will try to provide those who want to practise with the requisites for this. But it should not be allowed that because one has taken to religious practice he will prevent others from study or preaching. Any one infringing this rule shall be immediately asked to clear out, and this is imperative.

The preachers at home should give lessons on devotion, knowledge, Yoga, and work by turns; for this, the days and hours should be fixed, and the routine hung up at the door of the class-room. That is to say, a seeker after devotion may not present himself on the day fixed for knowledge and feel wounded thereby; and so on.

None of you are fit for the Vâmâchâra form of practice. Therefore this should on no account be practised at the Math. Anyone demurring to this must step out of this Order. This form of practice must never even be mentioned in the Math. Ruin shall seize the wicked man, both here and hereafter, who would introduce vile Vamachara into His fold!

SOME GENERAL REMARKS

1. If any woman comes to have a talk with a Sannyasin, she should do it in the Visitors' Hall. No woman shall be allowed to enter any other room — except the Worship-room.

2. No Sannyasin shall be allowed to reside in the Women's Math. Anyone refusing to obey this rule shall be expelled from the Math. ""Better an empty fold than a wicked herd.""

3. Men of evil character shall be rigorously kept out. On no pretence shall their shadow even cross the threshold of my room. If anyone amongst you become wicked, turn him out at once, whoever he be. We want no black sheep. The Lord will bring lots of good people.

4. Any woman can come to the class-room (or preaching hall) during class time or preaching hour, but must leave the place directly when that period is over.

5. Never show temper, or harbour jealousy, or backbite another in secret. It would be the height of cruelty and hard-heartedness to take note of others' shortcoming instead of rectifying one's own.

6. There should be fixed hours of meals. Everyone must have a seat and a low dining table. He will sit on the former and put his plate on the latter, as is the custom in Rajputana.

THE OFFICE-BEARERS

All the office-bearers you should elect by ballot, as was the mandate of Lord Buddha. That is to say, one should propose that such and such should be the President this year; and all should write on bits of paper 'yes' or 'no' and put them in a pitcher. If the 'yes' have a majority, he should be elected President, and so on. Though you should elect office-bearers in this way, yet Isuggest that this year Brahmananda should be President, Nirmalananda, Secretary and Treasurer, Sadananda Librarian, and Ramakrishnananda, Abhedananda, Turiyananda, and Trigunatitananda should take charge of the teaching and preaching work by turns, and so on.

It is no doubt a good idea that Trigunatita has of starting a magazine. But I shall consent to it if only you can work jointly.

About doctrines and so forth I have to say only this, that if anyone accepts Paramahamsa Deva as Avatâra etc., it is all right; if he doesn't do so, it is just the same. The truth about it is that in point of character, Paramahamsa Deva beats all previous records; and as regards teaching, he was more liberal, more original, and more progressive than all his predecessors. In other words, the older Teachers were rather one-sided, while the teaching of this new Incarnation or Teacher is that the best point of Yoga, devotion, knowledge, and work must be combined now so as to form a new society. . . . The older ones were no doubt good, but this is the new religion of this age — the synthesis of Yoga, knowledge, devotion, and work — the propagation of knowledge and devotion to all, down to the very lowest, without distinction of age or sex. The previous Incarnations were all right, but they have been synthesised in the person of Ramakrishna. For the ordinary man and the beginner, steady devotion (Nishthâ) to an ideal is of paramount importance. That is to say, teach them that all great Personalities should be duly honoured, but homage should be paid now to Ramakrishna. There can be no vigour without steady devotion. Without it one cannot preach with the intensity of a Mahâvira (Hanumân). Besides, the previous ones have become rather old. Now we have a new India, with its new God, new religion, and new Vedas. When, O Lord, shall our land be free from this eternal dwelling upon the past? Well, a little bigotry alsois a necessity. But we must harbour no antagonistic feelings towards others.

If you consider it wise to be guided by my ideas and if you follow these rules, then I shall supply on all necessary funds. . . . Moreover, please show this letter to Gour-Mâ, Yogin-Mâ, and others, and through them establish a Women's Math. Let Gour-Ma be the President there for one year, and so on. But none of you shall be allowed to visit the place. They will manage their own affairs. They will not have to work at your dictation. I shall supply all necessary expenses for that work also.

May the Lord guide you in the right direction! Two persons went to see the Lord Jagannatha. One of them beheld the Deity — while the other saw some trash that was haunting his mind! My friends, many have no doubt served the Master, but whenever anyone would be disposed to consider himself an extraordinary personage, he should think that although he was associated with Shri Ramakrishna, he has seen only the trash that was uppermost in his mind! Were it not so, he would manifest the results. The Master himself used to quote, ""They would sing and dance in the name of the Lord but come to grief in the end."" The root of that degeneration is egotism — to think that one is just as great as any other, indeed! ""He used to love me too!"" — one would plead. Alas, Nick Bottom, would you then be thus translated? Would such a man envy or quarrel with another and degrade himself? Bear in mind that through His grace lots of men will be turned out with the nobility of gods — ay, wherever His mercy would drop! . . . Obedience is the first duty. Well, just do with alacrity what I ask you to. Let me see how you carry out these few small things. Then gradually great things will come to pass.

PS. Please read the contents of this letter to all, and let me know whether you consider the suggestions worth carrying out. Please tell Brahmananda that he who is the servant of all is their true master. He never becomes a leader in whose love there is a consideration of high or low. He whose love knows no end, and never stops to consider high or low, has the whole world lying at his feet.",V.,,2086,1,0

<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>In London once more. The climate now in England is nice and
cool. We have fire in the grate. We have a whole house to ourselves,
you know, this time. It is small but convenient, and in London they do
not cost so much as in America. Don't you know what I was thinking &#8212;
about your mother! I just wrote her a letter and duly posted it to her,
care of Monroe &amp; Co., 7 Rue Scribe, Paris. Some old friends are
here, and Miss MacLeod came over from the Continent. She is good as
gold, and as kind as ever. We have a nice little family, in the house,
with another monk from India. Poor man! &#8212; a typical Hindu with nothing
of that pluck and go which I have, he is always dreamy and gentle and
sweet! That won't do. I will try to put a little activity into him. I
have had two classes already &#8212; they will go on for four or five months
and after that to India I go. But it is to Amerique &#8212; there where the
heart is. I love the Yankee land. I like to see new things. I do not
care a fig to loaf about old ruins and mope a life out about old
histories and keep sighing about the ancients. I have too much vigour
in my blood for that. In America is the place, the<!--'Volume 7 Page 499'-->
people, the opportunity for everything. I have become horribly radical.
I am just going to India to see what I can do in that awful mass of
conservative jelly-fish, and start a new thing, entirely new &#8212; simple,
strong, new and fresh as the first born baby. The eternal, the
infinite, the omnipresent, the omniscient is a principle, not a person.
You, I, and everyone are but embodiments of that principle, and the
more of this infinite principle is embodied in a person, the greater is
he, and all in the end will be the perfect embodiment of that and thus
all will be one as they are now essentially. This is all there is of
religion, and the practice is through this feeling of oneness that is
love. All old fogy forms are mere old superstitions. Now, why struggle
to keep them alive? Why give thirsty people ditch-water to drink whilst
the river of life and truth flows by? This is only human selfishness,
nothing else. Life is short &#8212; time is flying &#8212; that place and people
where one's ideas work best should be the country and the people for
everyone. Ay, for a dozen bold hearts, large, noble, and sincere! </p>

<i>6th July, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER, (To Dr. Lewis I. Janes.) </p>
<p>Yours of the 25th June has duly reached and gave me great
pleasure. I am so glad to see the noble work progressing. I had learnt
with the greatest delight from Mrs. Bull of the work that is going to
be done in Cambridge this winter and no better person could have been
selected to direct it as yourself. May all power attend you. I will be
only too glad to write for the magazine from time to time and my first
instalment was to be in a few weeks, when I hope to get some leisure.
Certainly it goes without saying that no one of the types we call

</body></html>",2175,"DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER, (To Dr. Lewis I. Janes.)

Yours of the 25th June has duly reached and gave me great pleasure. I am so glad to see the noble work progressing. I had learnt with the greatest delight from Mrs. Bull of the work that is going to be done in Cambridge this winter and no better person could have been selected to direct it as yourself. May all power attend you. I will be only too glad to write for the magazine from time to time and my first instalment was to be in a few weeks, when I hope to get some leisure. Certainly it goes without saying that no one of the types we call religious ought to die — they like races require fresh infusion of blood in the form of ideas. It is wonderful to be able to sympathise with others from their standpoints of view.

By this time Goodwin and the other Swami must have reached America. They I trust will be of help to you in your noble work. Godspeed to all good work and infinite blessings on all workers for good.","Yours ever in the truth,

Salutation to Bhagavan Ramakrishna!

May you prosper! May this letter conveying blessings and cordial embrace make you happy! Nowadays this fleshy tabernacle of mine is comparatively well. Meseems, the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, the Chief among mountains, bring even the moribund back to life. And the fatigue of the journeys also seems to havesomewhat abated. I have already felt that yearning for Freedom — potent enough to put the heart into turmoil — which your letter suggests you are experiencing. It is this yearning that gradually brings on a concentration of the mind on the eternal Brahman. ""There is no other way to go by."" May this desire blaze up more and more in you, until all your past Karma and future tendencies are absolutely annihilated. Close upon the heels of that will follow, all on a sudden, the manifestation of Brahman, and with it the destruction of all craving for the sense-world.

<p class=""right"">ALAMBAZAR MATH, CALCUTTA, <br>
<i>May 5th, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. BULL, </p>
<p>I have been to Darjeeling for a month to recuperate my
shattered health. I am very much better now. The disease disappeared
altogether in Darjeeling. I am going tomorrow to Almora, another hill
station, to perfect this improvement. </p>
<p>Things are looking not very hopeful here as I have already
written you &#8212; though the whole nation has risen as one man to honour me
and people went almost mad over me! The practical part cannot be had in
India. Again, the price of the land has gone up very much near
Calcutta. My idea at present is to start three centres at three
capitals. These would be my normal schools, from thence I want to
invade India. </p>
<p>India is already Ramakrishna's whether I live a few years more
or not. </p>
<p>I have a very kind letter from Prof. Janes in which he points
out my remarks about degraded Buddhism. You also write that Dharmapala
is very wroth about it. Mr. Dharmapala is a good man, and I love him;
but it would be entirely wrong for him to go into fits over things
Indian. </p>
<p>I am perfectly convinced that what they call modern Hinduism
with all its ugliness is only stranded Buddhism. Let the Hindus
understand this clearly, and then it would be easier for them to reject
it without murmur. As for the ancient form which the Buddha preached, I
have the greatest respect for it, as well as for His person. And you
well know that we Hindus worship Him as an Incarnation. Neither is the
Buddhism of Ceylon any good. My visit to Ceylon has entirely
disillusioned me, and the<!--'Volume 7 Page 506'--> only
living people there are the Hindus. The Buddhists are all much
Europeanised &#8212; even Mr. Dharmapala and his father had European names,
which they have since changed. The only respect the Buddhists pay to
their great tenet of non-killing is by opening ""butcher-stalls"" in
every place! And the priests encourage this. The real Buddhism, I once
thought, would yet do much good. But I have given up the idea entirely,
and I clearly see the reason why Buddhism was driven out of India, and
we will only be too glad if the Ceylonese carry off the remnant of this
religion with its hideous idols and licentious rites. </p>
<p>About the Theosophists, you must remember first that in India
Theosophists and Buddhists are nonentities. They publish a few papers
and make a lot of splash and try to catch Occidental ears. . . </p>
<p>I was one man in America and another here. Here the whole
nation is looking upon me as their authority &#8212; there I was a much
reviled preacher. Here Princes draw my carriage, there I would not be
admitted to a decent hotel. My utterances here, therefore, must be for
the good of the race, my people &#8212; however unpleasant they might appear
to a few. Acceptance, love, toleration for everything sincere and
honest &#8212; but never for hypocrisy. The Theosophists tried to fawn upon
and flatter me as I am the authority now in India, and therefore it was
necessary for me to stop my work giving any sanction to their humbugs,
by a few bold, decisive words; and the thing is done. I am very glad.
If my health had permitted, I would have cleared India by this time of
these upstart humbugs, at least tried my best. . . . Let me tell you
that India is already Ramakrishna's and for a purified Hinduism I have
organised my work here a bit.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=""right"">ALMORA, <br>
<i>11th July, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>My dear Shuddhananda,</p>
<p>I was very glad to receive your last report. I have very
little criticism to make except that you ought to write a bit more
legibly. </p>
<p>I am quite satisfied with the work done so far, but it must be
pushed forward. I have not learnt as yet of the suggestion I made
before as to getting a set of chemical and physical apparatus and
starting classes in elementary and experimental Chemistry and Physics,
especially in Physiology. </p>
<p>What about the other suggestion of buying sets of all the
scientific books that have been translated into Bengali? </p>
<p>It now seems to me that there must at least be three Mahantas
(heads) elected at a time &#8212; one to direct the business part, one the
experimental, the other the intellectual part. </p>
<p>The difficulty is to get the director of education.
Brahmananda and Turiyananda may well fill the other two. Of visitors I
am sorry to learn that you are only getting Babus from Calcutta. They
are no good. What we want are brave young men who will work, not
tomfools. </p>
<p>Ask Brahmananda to write to both Abhedananda and Saradananda
to send weekly reports to the Math without fail, also to send Bengali
articles and notes for the would-be paper. Is G. C. Ghosh getting up
things for the paper? Work on with a will and be ready. </p>
<p>Akhandananda is working wonderfully at Mahula, but the system
is not good. It seems they are frittering away their energies in one
little village and that only doling out rice. I do not hear that any
preaching has been done along with this helping. All the wealth of the<!--'Volume 7 Page 508'-->
world cannot help one little Indian village if the people are not
taught to help themselves. Our work should be mainly <i>educational</i>,
both moral and intellectual. I have not learnt anything abut it &#8212; only
so many <i>beggars are helped</i>! Ask Brahmananda to open
centres in different districts so as to cover the largest space with
our small means. </p>
<p>And then, so far it seems to have been ineffectual, for they
have not succeeded in rousing the people of the place to start
societies to educate the people, so that they may learn to be
self-reliant, frugal, and not given to marrying, and thus save
themselves from future famine. Charity opens the heart, but work on
through that wedge. </p>
<p>The easiest way is to take a hut &#8212; make it a temple of Guru
Maharaj! Let the poor come here to be helped, also to worship. Let
there be Kathâ (Puranic recitals) morning and evening there &#8212; through
that you may teach all you want to teach the people. By degrees the
people will be interested. They will keep up the temple themselves;
maybe the hut temple will evolve into a great institution in a few
years. Let those that go to relief-work first select a central spot in
each district and start such a hut-temple, from which all our little
work is to proceed. </p>
<p>Even the greatest fool can accomplish a task if it be after
his heart. But the intelligent man is he who can convert every work
into one that suits his taste. No work is petty. Everything in this
world is like a banyan-seed, which, though appearing tiny as a
mustard-seed, has yet the gigantic banyan tree latent within it. He
indeed is intelligent who notices this and succeeds in making all work
truly great. (This paragraph only is translated from <a href=""b7354e7040.pdf"">Bengali.</a><!--'Volume 7 Page 508'-->
)</p>
<p>Moreover, they have to see that cheats do not get the food of
the deserving. India is full of lazy rogues, and curious, they never
die of hunger, they always get some<!--'Volume 7 Page 509'-->
thing. Ask Brahmananda to write this to everyone in relief-work &#8212; they
must not be allowed to spend money to no good. We want the greatest
possible good work permanent from the least outlay. </p>
<p>Now you see you must try to think out original ideas &#8212; else,
as soon as I die, the whole thing will tumble to pieces. For example,
you hold a meeting to consider, ""How we can reap the best permanent
results out of the small means at our disposal."" Let all have notice a
few days before and let each suggest something and discuss all the
suggestions, criticising them; and then send me a report. </p>
<p>Lastly, you must remember I expect more from my children than
from my brethren. I want each one of my children to be a hundred times
greater than I could ever be. Everyone of you must be a giant &#8212; <i>must</i>,
that is my word. Obedience, readiness, and love for the cause &#8212; if you
have these three, nothing can hold you back.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>XLII</h2>
<p class=""right"">ALMORA, <br>
<i>29th July, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MISS NOBLE, </p>
<p>A letter from Sturdy reached me yesterday, informing me that
you are determined to come to India and see things with your own eyes.
I replied to that yesterday, but what I learnt from Miss Muller about
your plans makes this further note necessary, and it is better that it
should be direct. </p>
<p>Let me tell you frankly that I am now convinced that you have
a great future in the work for India. What was wanted was not a man,
but a woman &#8212; a real lioness &#8212; to work for the Indians, women
specially. </p>
<p>India cannot yet produce great women, she must borrow them
from other nations. Your education, sincerity, purity, immense love,
determination, and above all, the Celtic blood make you just the woman
wanted. </p>
<p>Yet the difficulties are many. You cannot form any idea of
misery, the superstition, and the slavery that are here. You will be in
the midst of a mass of half-naked men and women with quaint ideas of
caste and isolation, shunning the white skin through fear or hatred and
hated by them intensely. On the other hand, you will be looked upon by
the white as a crank, and every one of your movements will be watched
with suspicion. </p>
<p>Then the climate is fearfully hot; our winter in most places
being like your summer, and in the south it is always blazing. </p>
<p>Not one European comfort is to be had in places out of the
cities. If in spite of all this, you dare venture into the work, you
are welcome, a hundred times welcome. As for me, I am nobody here as
elsewhere, but what little influence I have shall be devoted to your
service. </p>
<p>You must think well before you plunge in; and after<!--'Volume 7 Page 512'-->
work, if you fail in this or get disgusted, on my part I promise you, <a name=""from_east_west""></a><i>I
will stand by you unto death</i> whether you work for India or
not, whether you give up Vedanta or remain in it. ""The tusks of the
elephant come out, but never go back""; so are the words of a man never
retracted. I promise you that. Again, I must give you a bit of warning.
You must stand on your own feet and not be under the wings of Miss
Muller or anybody else. Miss Muller is a good lady in her own way, but

in a few days. She now intends to take a house in Calcutta for herself

get them to work with you, and that will be really helpful to them and
to you. But after all it is absolutely necessary to stand on one's own
feet. </p>
<p>I learn from America that two friends of mine, Mrs. Ole Bull

</body></html>",5232,"MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,

A letter from Sturdy reached me yesterday, informing me that you are determined to come to India and see things with your own eyes. I replied to that yesterday, but what I learnt from Miss Muller about your plans makes this further note necessary, and it is better that it should be direct.

Let me tell you frankly that I am now convinced that you have a great future in the work for India. What was wanted was not a man, but a woman — a real lioness — to work for the Indians, women specially.

India cannot yet produce great women, she must borrow them from other nations. Your education, sincerity, purity, immense love, determination, and above all, the Celtic blood make you just the woman wanted.

Yet the difficulties are many. You cannot form any idea of misery, the superstition, and the slavery that are here. You will be in the midst of a mass of half-naked men and women with quaint ideas of caste and isolation, shunning the white skin through fear or hatred and hated by them intensely. On the other hand, you will be looked upon by the white as a crank, and every one of your movements will be watched with suspicion.

Then the climate is fearfully hot; our winter in most places being like your summer, and in the south it is always blazing.

Not one European comfort is to be had in places out of the cities. If in spite of all this, you dare venture into the work, you are welcome, a hundred times welcome. As for me, I am nobody here as elsewhere, but what little influence I have shall be devoted to your service.

You must think well before you plunge in; and afterwork, if you fail in this or get disgusted, on my part I promise you,I will stand by you unto deathwhether you work for India or not, whether you give up Vedanta or remain in it. ""The tusks of the elephant come out, but never go back""; so are the words of a man never retracted. I promise you that. Again, I must give you a bit of warning. You must stand on your own feet and not be under the wings of Miss Muller or anybody else. Miss Muller is a good lady in her own way, but unfortunately it got into her head, when she was a girl, that she was a born leader and that no other qualifications were necessary to move world but money! This idea is coming on the surface again and again in spite of herself, and you will find it impossible to pull on with her in a few days. She now intends to take a house in Calcutta for herself and yourself and other European or American friends who may come.

It is very kind and good of her, but her Lady Abbess plan will never be carried out for two reasons — her violent temper and overbearing conduct, and her awfully vacillating mind. Friendship with many is best at a distance, and everything goes well with the person who stands on his own feet.

Mrs. Sevier is a jewel of a lady —so good, so kind! The Seviers are theonlyEnglish people who do not hate thenatives, Sturdy not excepted. Mr. and Mrs. Sevier are the only persons whodid not cometo patronise us, but they have no fixed plans yet. When you come, you may get them to work with you, and that will be really helpful to them and to you. But after all it is absolutely necessary to stand on one's own feet.

<p>DEAR MADAM (Shrimati Sarala Ghosal, B. A.),</p>
<p>Very glad to receive your kind note. If by the sacrifice of
some specially cherished object of either myself or my
brother-disciples many pure and genuinely patriotic souls come forward
to help our cause, rest assured, we will not hesitate in the least to
make that sacrifice nor shed a tear-drop &#8212; you will see this verified
in action. But up till now I have seen nobody coming forward to assist
in this way. Only some have wished to put their own hobby in place of
ours &#8212; that is all. If it really help our country or humanity &#8212; not to
speak of giving up Guru-worship &#8212; believe me, we are prepared to commit
any dire iniquity and suffer the eternal damnation of the Christians.
But my hairs have turned grey since I began the study of man. This
world is a most trying place, and it is long since I have taken to
wandering with the lantern of the Grecian Philosopher in hand. A
popular song my Master often used to sing comes to my mind: </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 514'-->
<p class=""poem"">""He who's a man after one's heart <br>
Betrays himself by his very looks. <br>
Rare indeed is such a one! <br>
He's a man of aesthetic perceptions <br>
Who treads a path contrary to others.""</p>
<p>This much from my side. Please know that not one word of it is
exaggerated &#8212; which you will find to be actually the case. </p>
<p>But then I have some doubts about those patriotic souls who
can join with us if only we give up the worship of the Guru. Well, if,
as they pose, they are indeed panting and struggling so much &#8212; almost
to the point of dissolution from their body &#8212; to serve the country, how
can the single accident of Guru-worship stop everything! </p>
<p>This impetuous river with rolling waves which bade fair to
sweep away whole hills and mountains &#8212; was a bit of Guru-worship
sufficient to turn it back to the Himalayas! I put it to you, do you
think anything great will come of such patriotism, or any substantial
good proceed from such assistance? It is for you to say; I can make
nothing out of it. For a thirsty man to weigh so much the merits of
water, or for a man about to die of hunger to cogitate so much and turn
up his nose at the food presented! Well, people have strange ways of
thinking. I, for one, am inclined to think that those people were best
in a glass-case; the more they keep away from actual work, the better. </p>
<p class=""poem"">""Love stops not for questions of birth. <br>

<p>This is what I know. But I may be wholly mistaken. Well, if

<p class=""right"">C/O F. H. LEGGETT, <br>
21 WEST THIRTY-FOURTH STREET <br>
NEW YORK <br>
<i>Nov</i>.<i>, 1899</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR STURDY, </p>
<p>This is not to defend my conduct. Words cannot wipe off the
evils I have done, nor any censor stop from working the good deeds, if
any. </p>
<p>For the last few months I have been hearing so much of the
luxuries I was given to enjoy by the people of the West &#8212; luxuries
which the hypocrite myself has been enjoying, although preaching
renunciation all the while: luxuries, the enjoyment of which has been
the great stumbling-block in my way, in England at least. I nearly
hypnotised myself into the belief that there has at least been a little
oasis in the dreary desert of my life, a little spot of light in one
whole life of misery and gloom; one moment of relaxation in a life of
hard work and harder curses &#8212; even that oasis, that spot, that moment
was only one of sense-enjoyment!! </p>
<p>I was glad, I blessed a hundred times a day those that had
helped me to get it, when, lo, your last letter comes like a
thunderclap, and the dream is vanished. I begin to disbelieve your
criticisms &#8212; have little faith left in all this talk of luxuries and
enjoyments and other visions memory calls up. These I state. Hope you
will send it round to friends, if you think fit, and correct me where I
am wrong. </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 516'-->
<p>I remember your place at Reading, where I was fed with boiled
cabbage and potatoes and boiled rice and boiled lentils, three times a
day, with your wife's curses for sauce all the time. I do not remember
your giving me any cigar to smoke &#8212; shilling or penny ones. Nor do I
remember myself as complaining of either the food or your wife's
incessant curses, though I lived as a thief, shaking through fear all
the time, and working every day for you. </p>
<p>The next memory is of the house on St. George's Road &#8212; you and
Miss Muller at the head. My poor brother was ill there and Miss Müller
drove him away. There too I don't remember to have had any luxuries as
to food or drink or bed or even the room given to me. </p>
<p>The next was Miss Müller's place. Though she has been very
kind to me, I was living on nuts and fruits. The next memory is that of
the black hole of London where I had to work almost day and night and
cook the meals oft-times for five or six, and most nights with a bite
of bread and butter. </p>
<p>I remember Mrs. Sturdy giving me a dinner and a night's
lodging in her place, and then the next day criticising the black
savage &#8212; so dirty and smoking all over the house. </p>
<p>With the exception of Capt. and Mrs. Sevier, I do not remember
even one piece of rag as big as a handkerchief I got from England. On
the other hand, the incessant demand on my body and mind in England is
the cause of my breakdown in health. This was all you English people
gave me, whilst working me to death; and now I am cursed for the
luxuries I lived in!! Whosoever of you have given me a coat? Whosoever
a cigar? Whosoever a bit of fish or flesh? Whosoever of you dare say I
asked food or drink or smoke or dress or money from you? Ask, Sturdy,
ask for God's sake, ask your friends, and first ask your own ""God
within who never sleeps."" </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 517'-->
<p>You have given me money for my work. Every penny of it is
there. Before your eyes I sent my brother away, perhaps to his death;
and I would not give him a farthing of the money which was not my
private property. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I remember in England Capt. and Mrs.
Sevier, who have clad me when I was cold, nursed me better than my own
mother would have, borne with me in my weakness, my trials; and they
have nothing but blessings for me. And that Mrs. Sevier, because she
did not care for honours, has the worship of thousands today; and when
she is dead millions will remember her as one of the great
benefactresses of the poor Indians. And they never cursed me for my
luxuries, though they are ready to give me luxuries, if I need or wish.
</p>
<p>I need not tell you of Mrs. Bull, Miss MacLeod, Mr. and Mrs.
Leggett. You know their love and kindness for me; and Mrs. Bull and
Miss MacLeod have been to our country, moved and lived with us as no
foreigner ever did, roughing it all, and they do not ever curse me and
my luxuries either; they will be only too glad to have me eat well and
smoke dollar cigars if I wish. And there Leggetts and Bulls were the
people whose bread whose money bought my smokes and several times paid
my rent, whilst I was killing myself for your people, when you were
taking <i>my pound of flesh</i> for the dirty hole and
starvation and reserving all this accusation of luxury. </p>
<p class=""poem"">""The clouds of autumn make great noise but
send no rain;<br>
The clouds of the rainy season without a word flood the earth.""</p>
<p>See Sturdy, those that have helped or are still helping have
no criticism, no curses: it is only those who do nothing, who only come
to grind their own axes, that curse, that criticise. That such
worthless, heartless,<!--'Volume 7 Page 518'--> selfish,
rubbish criticise, is the greatest blessing that can come to me. I want
nothing so much in life as to be miles off from these extremely selfish
axe-grinders. </p>
<p>Talking of luxuries! Take these critics up one after the other
&#8212; It is all flesh, all flesh and no spirit anywhere. Thank God, they
come out sooner or later in their true colours. And you advise me to
regulate my conduct, my work, according to the desires of such
heartless, selfish persons, and are at your wit's end because I do not!
</p>
<p>As to my Gurubhais (brother-disciples), they do nothing but
what I insist on their doing. If they have shown any selfishness
anywhere, that is because of my ordering them, not what they would do
themselves. </p>
<p>Would you like your children put into that dark hole you got
for me in London, made to work to death, and almost starved all the
time? Would Mrs. Sturdy like that? They are Sannyasins, and that means,
no Sannyasin should unnecessarily throw away <i>his life or
undertake unnecessary hardship</i>. </p>
<p>In undergoing all this hardship in the West we have been only
breaking the rules of Sannyasa. They are my brothers, my children. I do
not want them to die in holes for my sake. I don't, by all that is good
and true I don't, want them starved and worked and cursed for all their
pains. </p>
<p>A word more. I shall be very glad if you can point out to me
where I have preached torturing the flesh. As for the Shâstras
(scriptures), I shall be only too glad if a Shâstri (Pundit) dares
oppose us with the rules of life laid down for Sannyasins and
Paramahamsas. </p>
<p>Well, Sturdy, my heart aches. I understand it all. I know what
you are in &#8212; you are in the clutches of people who want to use you. I
don't mean your wife. She is too simple to be dangerous. But, my poor
boy, you have got the flesh-smell &#8212; a little money &#8212; and vultures are
around. Such is life. </p>
<!--'Volume 7 Page 519'-->
<p>You said a lot about ancient India. That India still lives,
Sturdy, is not dead, and that living India dares even today to deliver
her message without fear or favour of the rich, without fear of
anybody's opinion, either in the land where her feet are in chains or
in the very face of those who hold the end of the chain, her rulers.
That India still lives, Sturdy, India of undying love, of everlasting
faithfulness, the unchangeable, not only in manners and customs, but
also in love, in faith, in friendship. And I, the least of that India's
children, love you, Sturdy, with <i>Indian</i> love, and
would any day give up a thousand bodies to help you out of this
delusion.&nbsp; </p>
<p class=""right"">Ever yours,</p>

That India still lives, Sturdy, is not dead, and that living India dares even today to deliver her message without fear or favour of the rich, without fear of anybody's opinion, either in the land where her feet are in chains or in the very face of those who hold the end of the chain, her rulers. That India still lives, Sturdy, India of undying love, of everlasting faithfulness, the unchangeable, not only in manners and customs, but also in love, in faith, in friendship. And I, the least of that India's children, love you, Sturdy, withIndianlove, and would any day give up a thousand bodies to help you out of this delusion.","Ever yours,

<p>DEAR MARGOT, </p>
<p>Your sixth has arrived, but with it yet no change in my
fortune. Would change be any good, do you think? Some people are made
that way, to love being miserable. If I did not break my heart over
people I was born amongst, I would do it for somebody else. I am sure
of that. This is the way of some, I am coming to see it. We are all
after happiness, true, but that some are only happy in being unhappy &#8212;
queer, is it not? There is no harm in it either, except that happiness
and unhappiness are both infectious. Ingersoll said once that if he
were God, he would make health catching, instead of disease, little
dreaming that health is quite as catching as disease, if not more! That
is the only danger. No harm in the world in my being happy, in being
miserable, but others must not catch it. This is the great fact. No
sooner a prophet feels miserable for the state of man than he sours<!--'Volume 7 Page 521'-->
his face, beats his breast, and calls upon everyone to drink tartaric
acid, munch charcoal, sit upon a dung-heap covered with ashes, and
speak only in groans and tears! &#8212; I find they all have been wanting.
Yes, they have. If you are really ready to take the world's burden,
take it by all means. But do not let us hear your groans and curses. Do
not frighten us with your sufferings, so that we came to feel we were
better off with our own burdens. The man who really takes the burden
blesses the world and goes his own way. He has not a word of
condemnation, a word of criticism, not because there was no evil but
that he has taken it on his own shoulders willingly, voluntarily. It is
the Saviour who should ""go his way rejoicing, and not the saved"". </p>
<p>This is the only light I have caught this morning. This is
enough if it has come to live with me and permeate my life. </p>
<p>Come ye that are heavy laden and lay all your burden on me,
and then do whatever you like and be happy and forget that I ever
existed. </p>

<p>Very happy to receive your kind letter even here. I had not
the least difficulty in reaching your house from the station of Nadiad.
And your brothers, they are what they should be, <i>your brothers</i>.
May the Lord shower his choicest blessings on your family. I have never
found such a glorious one in all my travels. Your friend Mr. Manibhai
has provided every comfort for me; but, as to his company, I have only
seen him twice; once for a minute, the other for ten minutes at the
most when he talked about the system of education here. Of course, I
have seen the Library and the pictures of Ravi Varma, and that is about
all worth seeing here. So I am going off this evening to Bombay. My
thanks to the Diwanji here (or to you) for his kind behaviour. More

the less said the better; but of course there are Dakshinis and
Dakshinis, and I would only quote to you what Shankar Pandurang wrote
me at Mahabaleshwar on my informing him that I had found shelter with
the Limdi Thakore: </p>
<p>""I am so glad to learn that you have found Limdi Thakore
there, else you would have been in serious troubles, our Maratha people
not being so kind as the Gujaratis."" So kind? heaven and hell! </p>
<p>I am very glad that your joint has now been nearly perfectly
cured. Kindly tell your noble brother to excuse my promise-breaking as
I have got here some Sanskrit books and help, too, to read, which I do
not hope to get elsewhere, and am anxious to finish them. Yesterday I
saw your friend Mr. Manahsukharam who has lodged a Sannyâsin friend
with him. He is very kind to me and so is his son. </p>
<p>After remaining here for 15 to 20 days I would proceed toward
Rameshwaram, and on my return would surely come to you. </p>
<p>The world really is enriched by men, high-souled,
noble-minded, and kind, like you; the rest are ""only as axes which cut

<p>It is impossible that I should ever forget your fatherly
kindness and care of me, and what else can a poor fakir like me do in
return to a mighty minister but pray that the Giver of all gifts may
give you all that is desirable on earth and in the end &#8212; which may He

cannot wander about in this heat &#8212; I would die. Secondly, my fast
friends in Rajputana would keep me bound down to their sides if they
get hold of me and<!--'Volume 8 Page 292'--> would not let
me go over to Europe. So my plan was to get hold of some new person
without my friends' knowledge. But this delay at Madras has dashed all
my hopes to the ground, and with a deep sigh I give it up, and the

you in a few days for a day or two in Madras and then go to Bangalore

DEAR ALASINGA,

Your friend, the young graduate, came to receive me at the station, so also a Bengali gentleman. At present I am living with the Bengali gentleman; tomorrow I go to live with your young friend for a few days, and then I see the different sights here, and in a few days you may expect me at Madras.

In that case I would have months left in my hands to seek out for somebody amongst our northern princes to send me over to America. But alas, it is now too late. First, I cannot wander about in this heat — I would die. Secondly, my fast friends in Rajputana would keep me bound down to their sides if they get hold of me andwould not let me go over to Europe. So my plan was to get hold of some new person without my friends' knowledge. But this delay at Madras has dashed all my hopes to the ground, and with a deep sigh I give it up, and the Lord's will be done!

<i>May, 1893</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, </p>
<p>Surely my letter had not reached you before you wrote to me.
The perusal of your letter gave me both<!--'Volume 8 Page 294'-->
pleasure and pain simultaneously: pleasure, to see that I have the good
fortune to be loved by a man of your heart, power, and position; and
pain, to see that my motive has been misinterpreted throughout. Believe
me, that I love you and respect you like a father and that my gratitude
towards you and your family is surely unbounded. The fact is this. You
may remember that I had from before a desire to go to Chicago. When at
Madras, the people there, of their own accord, in conjunction with H.H.
of Mysore and Ramnad made every arrangement to send me up. And you may
also remember that between H.H. of Khetri and myself there are the
closest ties of love. Well, I, as a matter of course, wrote to him that
I was going to America. Now the Raja of Khetri thought in his love that
I was bound to see him once before I departed, especially as the Lord
has given him an heir to the throne and great rejoicings were going on
here; and to make sure of my coming he sent his Private Secretary all
the way to Madras to fetch me, and of course I was bound to come. In
the meanwhile I telegraphed to your brother at Nadiad to know whether
you were there, and, unfortunately, the answer I could not get;
therefore, the Secretary who, poor fellow, had suffered terribly for
his master in going to and from Madras and with his eye wholly on the
fact that his master would be unhappy if we could not reach Khetri
within the Jalsa (festival), bought tickets at once for Jaipur. On our
way we met Mr. Ratilal who informed me that my wire was received and
duly answered and that Mr. Viharidas was expecting me. Now it is for
you to judge, whose duty it has been so long to deal even justice. What
would or could I do in this connection? If I would have got down, I
could not have reached in time for the Khetri rejoicings; on the other
hand, my motives might be misinterpreted. But I know you and your
brother's love for me, and I knew also that I would have to go<!--'Volume 8 Page 295'-->
back to Bombay in a few days on my way to Chicago. I thought that the
best solution was to postpone my visit till my return. As for my
feeling affronted at not being attended by your brothers, it is a new
discovery of yours which I never even dreamt of; or, God knows,
perhaps, you have become a thought-reader. Jokes apart, my dear Diwanji
Saheb, I am the same frolicsome, mischievous but, I assure you,
innocent boy you found me at Junagad, and my love for your noble self
is the same or increased a hundredfold, because I have had a mental
comparison between yourself and the Diwans of nearly all the states in
Dakshin, and the Lord be my witness how my tongue was fluent in your
praise (although I know that my powers are quite inadequate to estimate
your noble qualities) in every Southern court. If this be not a
sufficient explanation, I implore you to pardon me as a father pardons
a son, and let me not be haunted with the impression that I was ever
ungrateful to one who was so good to me.</p>

PS. I depend on you to remove any misconception in the mind of your
brother about my not getting down and that, even had I been the very
devil, I could not forget their kindness and good offices for me. </p>
<p>As to the other two Swamis, they were my Gurubhais, who went
to you last at Junagad; of them one is our leader. I met them after
three years, and we came together as far as Abu and then I left them.
If you wish, I can take them back to Nadiad on my way to Bombay. May
the Lord shower His blessings on you and yours.</p>

<p>Reached Bombay a few days ago and would start off in a few
days. Your friend, the Banya gentleman to whom you wrote for the house
accommodation, writes to say that his house is already full of guests
and some of them are ill and that he is very sorry he cannot

and kindness to me. He is what they call a Tazimi Sardar in Rajputana,
i.e. one of those whom the Rajas receive by rising from their seats.
Still he is so simple, and sometimes his service for me makes me almost
ashamed. </p>
<p>. . . Often and often, we see that the very best of men even
are troubled and visited with tribulations in this world; it may be
inexplicable; but it is also the experience of my life that the heart
and core of everything here is good, that whatever may be the surface
waves, deep down and underlying everything, there is an infinite basis
of goodness and love; and so long as we do not reach that basis, we are
troubled; but having once reached that zone of calmness, let winds howl
and tempests rage. The house which is built on a rock of ages cannot
shake. I thoroughly believe that a good, unselfish and holy man like
you, whose whole life has been devoted to doing good to others, has
already reached this basis of firmness which the Lord Himself has
styled as ""rest upon Brahman"" in the Gita. </p>

<p class=""right"">CHICAGO, <br>
<i>29th January, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, </p>
<p>Your last letter reached me a few days ago. You had been to
see my poor mother and brothers. I am glad you did. But you have
touched the only soft place in my heart. You ought to know, Diwanji,
that I am no hard-hearted brute. If there is any being I love in the
whole world, it is my mother. Yet I believed and still believe that
without my giving up the world, the great mission which Ramakrishna
Paramahamsa, my great Master came to preach would not see the light,
and where would those young men be who have stood as bulwarks against
the surging waves of materialism and luxury of the day? These have done
a great amount of good to India, especially to Bengal, and this is only
the beginning. With the Lord's help they will do things for which the
whole world will bless them for ages. So on the one hand, my vision of
the future of Indian religion and that of the whole world, my love for
the millions of beings sinking down and down for ages with nobody to
help them, nay, nobody with even a thought for them; on the other hand,
making those who are nearest and<!--'Volume 8 Page 298'-->
dearest to me miserable; I choose the former. ""Lord will do the rest.""
He is with me, I am sure of that if of anything. So long as I am
sincere, nothing can resist me, because He will be my help. Many and
many in India could not understand me; and how could they, poor men?
Their thoughts never strayed beyond the everyday routine business of
eating and drinking. I know only a few noble souls like yourself
appreciate me. Lord bless your noble self. But appreciation or no
appreciation, I am born to organise these young men; nay, hundreds more
in every city are ready to join me; and I want to send them rolling

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB,

Your last letter reached me a few days ago. You had been to see my poor mother and brothers. I am glad you did. But you have touched the only soft place in my heart. You ought to know, Diwanji, that I am no hard-hearted brute. If there is any being I love in the whole world, it is my mother. Yet I believed and still believe that without my giving up the world, the great mission which Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, my great Master came to preach would not see the light, and where would those young men be who have stood as bulwarks against the surging waves of materialism and luxury of the day? These have done a great amount of good to India, especially to Bengal, and this is only the beginning. With the Lord's help they will do things for which the whole world will bless them for ages. So on the one hand, my vision of the future of Indian religion and that of the whole world, my love for the millions of beings sinking down and down for ages with nobody to help them, nay, nobody with even a thought for them; on the other hand, making those who are nearest anddearest to me miserable; I choose the former. ""Lord will do the rest."" He is with me, I am sure of that if of anything. So long as I am sincere, nothing can resist me, because He will be my help. Many and many in India could not understand me; and how could they, poor men? Their thoughts never strayed beyond the everyday routine business of eating and drinking. I know only a few noble souls like yourself appreciate me. Lord bless your noble self. But appreciation or no appreciation, I am born to organise these young men; nay, hundreds more in every city are ready to join me; and I want to send them rolling like irresistible waves over India, bringing comfort, morality, religion, education to the doors of the meanest and the most downtrodden. And this I will do or die.

Our people have no idea, no appreciation. On the other hand, that horrible jealousy and suspicious nature which is the natural outcome of a thousand years of slavery make them stand as enemies to every new idea. Still the Lord is great.

About the Ârati as well as other things you speak of, it is the form in every one of the monasteries in all parts of India, and the worshipping of Guru is the first duty inculcated in the Vedas. It has its bad and good sides. But you must remember we are a unique company, nobody amongst us has a right to force his faith upon the others.

Similarly God, though everywhere, we can only conceive Him as a big man.

Wait, Diwanji, the Lord is great and merciful, you will see more.

We do not only tolerate but accept every religion, and with the Lord's help I am trying to preach it to the whole world.

Three things are necessary to make every man great, every nation great:

1. Conviction of the powers of goodness.2. Absence of jealousy and suspicion.3. Helping all who are trying to be and do good.

Why should the Hindu nation with all its wonderful intelligence and other things have gone to pieces? I would answer you,jealousy. Never were there people more wretchedly jealous of one another, more envious of one another's fame and name than this wretched Hindu race.

<p>DEAR SISTERS, </p>
<p>I am now living with Mr. Palmer. He is a very nice gentleman.
He gave a dinner the night before last to a group of his old friends,
each more than 60 years of age, which he calls his ""old boys' club"". I
spoke at an opera house for two hours and a half. People were very much
pleased. I am going to Boston and New York. I will get here sufficient
to cover my expenses there. I have forgotten the addresses of both
Flagg and Prof. Wright. I am not going to lecture in Michigan, Mr.
Holden tried<!--'Volume 8 Page 301'--> to persuade me this
morning to lecture in Michigan but I am quite bent upon seeing a little
of Boston and New York. To tell you the truth, the more I am getting
popularity and facility in speaking, the more I am getting fed up. My
last address was the best I ever delivered. Mr. Palmer was in ecstasies
and the audience remained almost spellbound, so much so that it was
after the lecture that I found I had spoken so long. A speaker always
feels the uneasiness or inattention of the audience. Lord save me from
such nonsense, I am fed up. I would take rest in Boston or New York if
the Lord permits. My love to you all. May you ever be happy!</p>

<p>DEAR BABIES, </p>
<p>I am pulling on well with old Palmer. He is a very jolly, good
old man. I got only 127 dollars by my last lecture. I am going to speak
again in Detroit on Monday. Your mother asked me to write to a lady in
Lynn. I have never seen her. Is it etiquette to write without any
introduction? Please post me a little letter about this lady. Where is
Lynn? The funniest thing said about me here was in one of the papers
which said, ""The cyclonic Hindu has come and is a guest with Mr.
Palmer. Mr. Palmer has become a Hindu and is going to India; only he
insists that two reforms should be carried out: firstly that the Car of
Jagannath should be drawn by<!--'Volume 8 Page 302'-->
Percherons raised in Mr. Palmer's Loghouse Farm, and secondly that the
Jersey cow be admitted into the pantheon of Hindu sacred cows."" Mr.
Palmer is passionately fond of both Percheron horse and Jersey cow and
has a great stock of both in his Loghouse Farm. </p>
<p>The first lecture was not properly managed, the cost of the
hall being 150 dollars. I have given up Holden. Here is another fellow
cropped up; let me see if he does better. Mr. Palmer makes me laugh the
whole day. Tomorrow there is going to be another dinner party. So far
all is well; but I do not know &#8212; I have become very sad in my heart
since I am here &#8212; do not know why. </p>
<p>I am wearied of lecturing and all that nonsense. This mixing
with hundreds of varieties of the human animal has disturbed me. I will
tell you what is to my taste; I cannot write, and I cannot speak, but I
can think deeply, and when I am heated, can speak fire. It should be,
however, to a select, a very select &#8212; few. Let them, if they will,
carry and scatter my ideas broadcast &#8212; not I. This is only a just
division of labour. The same man never succeeded both in thinking and
in scattering his thoughts. A man should be free to think, especially
spiritual thoughts. </p>
<p>Just because this assertion of independence, this proving that
man is <i>not a machine</i>, is the essence of all
religious thought, it is impossible to think it in the routine
mechanical way. It is this tendency to bring everything down to the
level of a machine that has given the West its wonderful prosperity.
And it is this which has driven away all religion from its doors. Even
the little that is left, the West has reduced to a systematic drill. </p>
<p>I am really not ""cyclonic"" at all. Far from it. What I want is
not here, nor can I longer bear this ""cyclonic"" atmosphere. This is the
way to perfection, to strive to be perfect, and to strive to make
perfect a few men and women. My idea of doing good is this: to evolve
out a<!--'Volume 8 Page 303'--> few giants, and not to
strew pearls before swine, and so lose time, health, and energy. </p>
<p>Just now I got a letter from Flagg. He cannot help me in
lecturing. He says, ""First go to Boston."" Well, I do not care for
lecturing any more. It is too disgusting, this attempt to bring me to
suit anybody's or any audience's fads. However, I shall come back to
Chicago for a day or two at least before I go out of this country. Lord

<p>My heartfelt thanks for your kindly sending me the letter from
Calcutta. It was from my brethren at Calcutta, and it is written on the
occasion of a private invitation to celebrate the birthday of my Master
about whom you have heard so much from me &#8212; so I send it over to you.
The letter says that Mazoomdar has gone back to Calcutta and is
preaching that Vivekananda is committing every sin under the sun in
America. . . . This is your America's <i>wonderful spiritual man</i>!
It is not their fault; until one is really spiritual, that is, until
one has got a real insight into the nature of one's own soul and has
got a glimpse of the world of the soul, one cannot distinguish chaff
from seed, tall talk from depth, and so on. I am sorry for poor
Mazoomdar that he should stoop so low! Lord bless the old boy! </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 304'-->
<p>The address inside the letter is in English and is my old, old
name as written by a companion of my childhood who has also taken
orders. It is a very poetic name. That written in the letter is an
abbreviation, the full name being Narendra meaning the ""Chief of men""
(""nara"" means ""man"", and ""indra"" stands for ""ruler"", ""chief"") &#8212; very
ludicrous, isn't it? But such are the names in our country; we cannot
help, but I am glad I have given that up. </p>

<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>Your and Mother Church's letters came together just now,
acknowledging the receipt of the money. I am very glad to receive the
Khetri letter, which I send back for your perusal. You would find from
it that he wants some newspaper clippings. I do not think I have any
except the Detroit one, which I will send to him. If you can get hold
of some others, kindly send some over to him if it be possible and
convenient. You know his address &#8212; H. H. the Maharajah of Khetri,
Rajputana, India. Of course, this letter is for the perusal of the holy
family alone. Mrs. Breed wrote to me a stiff burning letter first, and
then today I got a telegram from her inviting me to be her guest for a
week. Before this I got a letter from Mrs. Smith of New York writing on
her behalf and another lady Miss Helen Gould and another Dr.__ to come
over to New York. As the Lynn Club<!--'Volume 8 Page 305'-->
wants me on the 17th of next month, I am going to New York first and
come in time for their meeting at Lynn. </p>
<p>Next summer, if I do not go away, which Mrs. Bagley insists I
should not, I may go to Annisquam where Mrs. Bagley has engaged a nice
house. Mrs. Bagley is a very spiritual lady, and Mr. Palmer a
spirituous gentleman but very good. What shall I write more? I am all
right in nice health of body and mind. May you all be blessed, ever
blessed, my dear, dear sisters. By the by, Mrs. Sherman has presented
me with a lot of things amongst which is a nail set and letter holder
and a little satchel etc., etc. Although I objected, especially to the
nail set, as very dudish with mother-of-pearl handles, she insisted and
I had to take them, although I do not know what to do with that
brushing instrument. Lord bless them all. She gave me one advice &#8212;
never to wear this Afrikee dress in society. Now I am a society man!

<p class=""center""><i>To Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai</i></p>
<p class=""right"">CHICAGO, <br>
<i>20th June, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, </p>
<p>Your very kind note came today. I am so sorry that I could
have caused pain to such a noble heart as yours with my rash and strong
words. I bow down to your mild corrections. ""Thy son am I, teach me
thus bowing"" &#8212; Gita. But you well know, Diwanji Saheb, it was my love<!--'Volume 8 Page 306'-->
that prompted me to say so. The backbiters, I must tell you, have not
indirectly benefited me; on the other hand, they have injured me
immensely in view of the fact that our Hindu people did not move a
finger to tell the Americans that I represented them. Had our people
sent some words thanking the American people for their kindness to me
and stating that I was representing them! . . . have been telling the
American people that I have donned the Sannyasin's garb only in America
and that I was a cheat, bare and simple. So far as reception goes, it
has no effect on the American nation; but so far as helping me with
funds goes, it has a terrible effect in making them take off their
helping hands from me. And it is one year since I have been here, and
not one man of note from India has thought it fit to make the Americans
know that I am no <i>cheat</i>. There again the
missionaries are always seeking for something against me, and they are
busy picking up anything said against me by the Christian papers of
India and publishing it here. Now you must know that the people here
know very little of the distinction in India between the Christian and
the Hindu. </p>
<p>Primarily my coming has been to raise funds for an enterprise
of my own. Let me tell it all to you again. </p>
<p>The whole difference between the West and the East is in this:
They are nations, we are not, i.e., civilisation, education here is
general, it penetrates into the masses. The higher classes in India and
America are the same, but the distance is infinite between the lower
classes of the two countries. Why was it so easy for the English to
conquer India? It was because they are a nation, we are not. When one
of our great men dies, we must sit for centuries to have another; they
can produce them as fast as they die. When our Diwanji Saheb will pass
away (which the Lord may delay long for the good of my country), the
nation will see the difficulty at once of filling his place, which is
seen even now in the fact that they<!--'Volume 8 Page 307'-->
cannot dispense with your services. It is the dearth of great ones. Why
so? Because they have such a bigger field of recruiting their great
ones, we have so small. A nation of 300 millions has the smallest field
of recruiting its great ones compared with nations of thirty, forty, or
sixty millions, because the number of educated men and women in those
nations is so great. Now do not mistake me, my kind friend, this is the
great defect in our nation and must be removed. </p>
<p>Educate and raise the masses, and thus alone a nation is
possible. Our reformers do not see where the wound is, they want to
save the nation by marrying the widows; do you think that a nation is
saved by the number of husbands its widows get? Nor is our religion to
blame, for an idol more or less makes no difference. The whole defect
is here: The real nation who live in cottage have forgotten their
manhood, their individuality. Trodden under the foot of the Hindu,
Mussulman, or Christian, they have come to think that they are born to
be trodden under the foot of everybody who has money enough in his
pocket. They are to be given back their lost individuality. They are to
be educated. Whether idols will remain or not, whether widows will have
husbands enough or not, whether caste is good or bad, I do not bother
myself with such questions. Everyone must work out his own salvation.
Our duty is to put the chemicals together, the crystallisation will
come through God's laws. Let us put ideas into their heads, and they
will do the rest. Now this means educating the masses. Here are these
difficulties. A pauper government cannot, will not, do anything; so no
help from that quarter. </p>
<p>Even supposing we are in a position to open schools in each
village free, still the poor boys would rather go to the plough to earn
their living than come to your school. Neither have we the money, nor
can we make them come to education. The problem seems hopeless.<!--'Volume 8 Page 308'-->
I have found a way out. It is this. If the mountain does not come to
Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain. If the poor cannot come to
education, education must reach them at the plough, in the factory,
everywhere. How? You have seen my brethren. Now I can get hundreds of
such, all over India, unselfish, good, and educated. Let these men go
from village to village bringing not only religion to the door of
everyone but also education. So I have a nucleus of organising the
widows also as instructors to our women. </p>
<p>Now suppose the villagers after their day's work have come to
their village and sitting under a tree or somewhere are smoking and
talking the time away. Suppose two of these educated Sannyasins get
hold of them there and with a camera throw astronomical or other
pictures, scenes from different nations, histories, etc. Thus with
globes, maps, etc. &#8212; and all this orally &#8212; how much can be done that
way, Diwanji? It is not that the eye is the only door of knowledge, the
ear can do all the same. So they would have ideas and morality, and
hope for better. Here our work ends. Let them do the rest. What would
make the Sannyasins do this sacrifice, undertake such a task? &#8212;
religious enthusiasm. Every new religious wave requires a new centre.
The old religion can only be revivified by a new centre. Hang your
dogmas or doctrines, they never pay. It is a character, a life, a
centre, a God-man that must lead the way, that must be the centre round
which all other elements will gather themselves and then fall like a
tidal wave upon the society, carrying all before it, washing away all
impurities. Again, a piece of wood can only easily be cut along the
grain. So the old Hinduism can only be reformed through Hinduism, and
not through the new-fangled reform movements. At the same time the
reformers must be able to unite in themselves the culture of both the
East and the West. Now do you not think that you have already<!--'Volume 8 Page 309'-->
seen the nucleus of such a great movement, that you have heard the low
rumblings of the coming tidal wave? That centre, that God-man to lead
was born in India. He was the great Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and round
him this band is slowly gathering. They will do the work. Now, Diwanji
Maharaj, this requires an organisation, money &#8212; a little at least to
set the wheel in motion. Who would have given us money in India? &#8212; So,
Diwanji Maharaj, I crossed over to America. You may remember I begged
all the money from the poor, and the offers of the rich I would not
accept because they could not understand my ideas. Now lecturing for a
year in this country, I could not succeed at all (of course, I have no
wants for myself) in my plan for raising some funds for setting up my
work. First, this year is a very bad year in America; thousands of
their poor are without work. Secondly, the missionaries and the Brahmo
Samajists try to thwart all my views. Thirdly, a year has rolled by,
and our countrymen could not even do so much for me as to say to the
American people that I was a real Sannyasin and no cheat, and that I
represented the Hindu religion. Even this much, the expenditure of a
few words, they could not do! Bravo, my countrymen! I love them,
Diwanji Saheb. Human help I spurn with my foot. He who has been with me
through hills and dales, through deserts or forests, will be with me, I
hope; if not, some heroic soul would arise some time or other in India,
far abler than myself, and carry it out. So I have told you all about
it. Diwanji, excuse my long letter, my noble friend, one of the few who
really feel for me, have real kindness for me. You are at liberty, my
friend, to think that I am a dreamer, a visionary; but believe at least
that I am sincere to the backbone, and my greatest fault is that I love
my country only too, too well. May you and yours be blessed ever and
ever, my noble, noble friend. May the shadow of the Almighty ever rest
on all those you love. I offer my<!--'Volume 8 Page 310'-->
eternal gratitude to you. My debt to you is immense, not only because
you are my friend, but also because you have all your life served the
Lord and your motherland so well.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=""center""><i>To a Madras disciple</i></p>
<p class=""right"">541 DEARBORN AVE., <br>
CHICAGO, <br>
<i>28 June, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR__ , </p>
<p>The other day I received a letter from G. G., Mysore. G. G.
unfortunately thinks that I am all-knowing, else he would have written
his Canarese address on the top of the letter more legibly. Then again
it is a great mistake to address me letters to any other place but
Chicago. It was my mistake of course at first, because I ought to have
thought of the fine Buddhi (intellect) of our friends who are throwing
letters at me anywhere they find an address at the top. But tell our
Madras Brihaspatis (i.e. wise fellows) that they already knew full well
that before their letters reach, I may be 1000 miles away from that
particular place, for I am continuously travelling. In Chicago there is
a friend whose house is my headquarters. </p>
<p>Now as to my prospects here &#8212; it is well-nigh zero. Why,
because although I had the best purpose, it has been made null and void
by these causes. All that I get about India is from Madras letters.
Your letters say again and again how I am being praised in India. But
that is<!--'Volume 8 Page 311'--> between you and me, for
I never saw a single Indian paper writing about me, except the three
square inches sent to me by Alasinga. On the other hand, everything
that is said by Christians in India is sedulously gathered by the
missionaries and regularly published, and they go from door to door to
make my friends give me up. They have succeeded only too well, for
there is not one word for me from India. Indian Hindu papers may laud
me to the skies, but not a word of that ever came to America, so that
many people in this country think me a fraud. In the face of the
missionaries and with the jealousy of the Hindus here to back them, I
have not a word to say. </p>
<p>I now think it was foolish of me to go to the Parliament on
the strength of the urging of the Madras boys. They are boys after all.
Of course, I am eternally obliged to them, but they are after all
enthusiastic young men without any executive abilities. I came here
without credentials. How else to show that I am not a fraud in the face
of the missionaries and the Brahmo Samaj? Now I thought nothing so easy
as to spend a few words; I thought nothing would be so easy as to hold
a meeting of some respectable persons in Madras and Calcutta and pass a
resolution thanking me and the American people for being kind to me and
sending it over officially, i.e. through the Secretary of the function,
to America, for instance, sending one to Dr. Barrows and asking him to
publish it in the papers and so on, to different papers of Boston, New
York, and Chicago. Now after all, I found that it is too terrible a
task for India to undertake. There has not been one voice for me in one
year and every one against me, for whatever you may say of me in your
homes, who knows anything of it here? More than two months ago I wrote
to Alasinga about this. He did not even answer my letter. I am afraid
his heart has grown lukewarm. So you must first think of that and then
show this letter to the Madras people. On the other hand, my<!--'Volume 8 Page 312'-->
brethren foolishly talk nonsense about Keshab Sen; and the Madrasis,
telling the Theosophists anything I write about them, are creating only
enemies. . . . Oh! If only I had one man of some true abilities and
brains to back me in India! But His will be done. I stand a fraud in
this country. It was my foolishness to go to the Parliament without any
credentials, hoping that there would be many for me. I have got to work
it out slowly. </p>
<p>On the whole, the Americans are a million times nobler than
the Hindus, and I can work more good here than in the country of the
ingrate and the heartless. After all, I must work my Karma out. So far
as pecuniary circumstances go I am all right and will be all right. The
number of Theosophists in all America is only 625 by the last census.
Mixing up with them will smash me in a minute rather than help me in
any way. What nonsense does Alasinga mean by my going to London to see
Mr. Old etc. Fool! the boys there don't know what they are talking. And

DEAR__ ,

The other day I received a letter from G. G., Mysore. G. G. unfortunately thinks that I am all-knowing, else he would have written his Canarese address on the top of the letter more legibly. Then again it is a great mistake to address me letters to any other place but Chicago. It was my mistake of course at first, because I ought to have thought of the fine Buddhi (intellect) of our friends who are throwing letters at me anywhere they find an address at the top. But tell our Madras Brihaspatis (i.e. wise fellows) that they already knew full well that before their letters reach, I may be 1000 miles away from that particular place, for I am continuously travelling. In Chicago there is a friend whose house is my headquarters.

Now as to my prospects here — it is well-nigh zero. Why, because although I had the best purpose, it has been made null and void by these causes. All that I get about India is from Madras letters. Your letters say again and again how I am being praised in India. But that isbetween you and me, for I never saw a single Indian paper writing about me, except the three square inches sent to me by Alasinga. On the other hand, everything that is said by Christians in India is sedulously gathered by the missionaries and regularly published, and they go from door to door to make my friends give me up. They have succeeded only too well, for there is not one word for me from India. Indian Hindu papers may laud me to the skies, but not a word of that ever came to America, so that many people in this country think me a fraud. In the face of the missionaries and with the jealousy of the Hindus here to back them, I have not a word to say.

I now think it was foolish of me to go to the Parliament on the strength of the urging of the Madras boys. They are boys after all. Of course, I am eternally obliged to them, but they are after all enthusiastic young men without any executive abilities. I came here without credentials. How else to show that I am not a fraud in the face of the missionaries and the Brahmo Samaj? Now I thought nothing so easy as to spend a few words; I thought nothing would be so easy as to hold a meeting of some respectable persons in Madras and Calcutta and pass a resolution thanking me and the American people for being kind to me and sending it over officially, i.e. through the Secretary of the function, to America, for instance, sending one to Dr. Barrows and asking him to publish it in the papers and so on, to different papers of Boston, New York, and Chicago. Now after all, I found that it is too terrible a task for India to undertake. There has not been one voice for me in one year and every one against me, for whatever you may say of me in your homes, who knows anything of it here? More than two months ago I wrote to Alasinga about this. He did not even answer my letter. I am afraid his heart has grown lukewarm. So you must first think of that and then show this letter to the Madras people. On the other hand, mybrethren foolishly talk nonsense about Keshab Sen; and the Madrasis, telling the Theosophists anything I write about them, are creating only enemies. . . . Oh! If only I had one man of some true abilities and brains to back me in India! But His will be done. I stand a fraud in this country. It was my foolishness to go to the Parliament without any credentials, hoping that there would be many for me. I have got to work it out slowly.

On the whole, the Americans are a million times nobler than the Hindus, and I can work more good here than in the country of the ingrate and the heartless. After all, I must work my Karma out. So far as pecuniary circumstances go I am all right and will be all right. The number of Theosophists in all America is only 625 by the last census. Mixing up with them will smash me in a minute rather than help me in any way. What nonsense does Alasinga mean by my going to London to see Mr. Old etc. Fool! the boys there don't know what they are talking. And this pack of Madras babies cannot even keep a counsel in their blessed noodles! Talk nonsense all day, and when it comes to the least business, they are nowhere! Boobies, who cannot get up a few meetings of 50 men each and send up a few emptywordsonly to help me, talk big about influencing the world. I have written to you about the phonograph.

<p>I came yesterday to this place, and shall remain here a few
days. I received in New York a letter from you but did not receive any <i>Interior</i>,
for which I am glad, because I am not perfect yet, and knowing the

these ""sweet Christian gentlemen"" in my heart.<!--'Volume 8 Page 315'-->
Our religion teaches that anger is a great sin, even if it is

distinguish ever the distinction between ""religious anger"" and
""commonplace anger"", ""religious killing"" and ""commonplace killing"",
""religious slandering and irreligious"", and so forth. Nor may that
""fine"" ethical distinction ever enter into the ethics of our nation!
Jesting apart, Mother Church, I do not care the least for the gambols

<p>DEAR BABIES, </p>
<p>Now don't let my letters stray beyond the circle, please. I
had a beautiful letter from sister Mary. See<!--'Volume 8 Page 317'-->
how I am getting the dash, sister Jeany teaches me all that. She can
jump and run and play and swear like a devil and talk slang at the rate
of 500 a minute; only she does not much care for religion, only a
little. She is gone today home, and I am going to Greenacre. I had been
to see Mrs. Breed. Mrs. Stone was there, with whom is residing Mrs.
Pullman and all the golden bugs, my old friends hereabouts. They are
kind as usual. On my way back from Greenacre I am going to Annisquam to
see Mrs. Bagley for a few days. </p>
<p>Darn it, forget everything. I had duckings in the sea like a
fish. I am enjoying every bit of it. What nonsense was the song Harriet
taught me ""dans la plaine"" the deuce take it. I told it to a French
scholar and he laughed and laughed till the fellow was well-nigh burst
at my wonderful translation. That is the way you would have taught me
French! You are a pack of fools and heathens, I tell you. Now are you
gasping for breath like a huge fish stranded? I am glad that you are
sizzling. Oh! how nice and cool it is here, and it is increased a
hundred-fold when I think about the gasping, sizzling, boiling, frying
four old maids, and how cool and nice I am here. Whoooooo! </p>

make a Himalayas there and start a monastery as sure as I am living &#8212; I
am not going to leave this country without throwing one more apple of
discord into this already roaring, fighting, kicking, mad whirlpool of
American religion. Well, dear old maids, you sometimes have a glimpse
of the lake and on every hot noon, think of going down to the bottom of
the lake, down, down, down, until it is cool and nice, and then to lie
down on the bottom, with that coolness above and around, and lie there

<p>DEAR SISTERS, </p>
<p>I have been all this time in Greenacre. I enjoyed this place
very much. They have been all very kind to me. One Chicago lady, Mrs.
Pratt of Kenilworth, wanted to give me $500; she became so much
interested in me; but I refused. She has made me promise that I would
send word to her whenever I need money, which I hope the Lord will
never put me in. His help alone is sufficient for me. I have not heard
anything from you nor from Mother. Neither have I any news from India
as to the arrival of the phonograph. </p>
<p>If there was anything in my letter to you which was offensive,
I hope you all know that I meant everything in love. It is useless to
express my gratitude to you for your kindness. Lord bless you and
shower His choicest blessings on you and those you love. To your family
I am ever, ever beholden. You know it. You feel it. I cannot express
it. On Sunday I am going to lecture at Plymouth at the ""Sympathy of
Religions"" meetings of Col. Higginson. Herewith I send a photograph
Cora Stockham took of the group under the tree. It is only a proof and
will fade away under exposure, but I cannot<!--'Volume 8 Page 319'-->
get anything better at present. Kindly tender my heartfelt love and
gratitude to Miss Howe. She has been so, so kind to me. I do not need
anything at present. I shall be very glad to let you know if I need
anything. I think I am going to Fishkill from Plymouth, where I will be
only a couple of days. I will write you again from Fishkill. Hope you
are all happy, or rather I know you are. Pure and good souls can never
be unhappy. I shall have a very nice time the few weeks I am here. I
will be in New York next fall. New York is a grand and good place. The
New York people have a tenacity of purpose unknown in any other city. I
had a letter from Mrs. Potter Palmer asking me to see her in August.
She is a very gracious and kind lady, etc. I have not much to say.
There is my friend Dr. Janes of New York, President of the Ethical

<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>Your kind note reached me this morning. I have been in this
hotel for about a week. I will remain in Boston some time yet. I have
plenty of gowns already, in fact, more than I can carry with ease. When
I had that drenching in Annisquam, I had on that beautiful black suit
you appreciate so much, and I do not think it can be damaged any way;
it also has been penetrated with my deep meditations on the Absolute. I
am very glad that you enjoyed the summer so well. As for me, I am
vagabondising. I was very much amused the other day at reading Abe
Hue's description of the vagabond lamas of Tibet &#8212; a true picture of
our fraternity. He says they are queer people. They come when they
will, sit at everybody's table, invitation or no invitation, live where
they will, and go where they will. There is not a mountain they have
not climbed, not a river they have not crossed, not a nation they do
not know, not a language they do not talk. He thinks that God must have
put into them a part of that energy which makes the planets go round
and round eternally. Today this vagabond lama was seized with a desire
of going right along scribbling, and so I walked down and entering a
store bought all sorts of writing material and a beautiful portfolio
which shuts with a clasp and has even a little wooden inkstand. So far
it promises well. Hope it will continue. Last month I had mail enough
from India and am greatly delighted with my countrymen at their
generous appreciation of my work. Good enough for them. I cannot find<!--'Volume 8 Page 322'-->

<p>Your kind note to G. W. Hale has been very gratifying, as I

there is only one country in the world which understands religion &#8212; it
is India; that with all their faults the Hindus are head and shoulders
above all other nations in morality and spirituality; and that with
proper care and attempt and struggle of all her disinterested sons, by
combining some of the active and heroic elements of the West with the
calm virtues of the Hindus, there will come a type of men far superior
to any that have ever been in this world. </p>

<p class=""right"">CHICAGO, <br>
<i>15th November, 1894</i>(<i>3</i>?).</p>
<p>DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai), </p>
<p>I here received your kind note. So very kind of you to
remember me even here, I have not seen your Narayan Hemchandra. He is
not in America, I believe. I have seen many strange sights and grand
things. I am glad that there is a good chance of your coming over to
Europe. Avail yourself of it by any means. The fact of our isolation
from all the other nations of the world is the cause of our
degeneration and its only remedy is getting back into the current of
the rest of the world. Motion is the sign of life. America is a grand
country. It is a paradise of the poor and women. There is almost no
poor in the country, and nowhere else in the world women are so free,
so educated, so cultured. They are everything in society. </p>
<p>This is a great lesson. The Sannyasin has not lost a bit of
his Sannyasinship, even his mode of living. And in this most hospitable
country, every home is open to me. The Lord who guides me in India,
would He not guide me here? And He has. </p>
<p>You may not understand why a Sannyasin should be in America,
but it was necessary. Because the only claim<!--'Volume 8 Page 326'-->
you have to be recognised by the world is your religion, and good
specimens of our religious men are required to be sent abroad to give
other nations an idea that India is not dead. </p>
<p>Some representative men must come out of India and go to all
the nations of the earth to show at least that you are not savages. You
may not feel the necessity of it from your Indian home, but, believe
me, much depends upon that for your nation. And a Sannyasin who has no
idea of doing good to his fellows is a brute, not a Sannyasin. </p>
<p>I am neither a sightseer nor an idle traveller; but you will
see, if you live to see, and bless me all your life. </p>
<p>Mr. Dvivedi's papers were too big for the Parliament, and they
had to be cut short. </p>
<p>I spoke at the Parliament of Religions, and with what effect I
may quote to you from a few newspapers and magazines ready at hand. I
need not be self-conceited, but to you in confidence I am bound to say,
because of your love, that no Hindu made such an impression in America,
and if my coming has done nothing, it has done this that the Americans
have come to know that India even today produces men at whose feet even
the most civilised nations may learn lessons of religion and morality.
Don't you think that is enough to say for the Hindu nation sending over
here their Sannyasin? You would hear the details from Virchand Gandhi. </p>
<p>These I quote from the journals: ""But eloquent as were many of
the brief speeches, no one expressed as well the spirit of the
Parliament (of religions) and its limitations as the Hindu monk. I copy
his address in full, but I can only suggest its effect upon the
audience; for he is an orator by Divine right, and his strong
intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was
hardly less interesting than these earnest words and<!--'Volume 8 Page 327'-->
the rich rhythmical utterance he gave them."" (Here the speech is quoted
<i>in extenso</i>.) <i>New York Critique</i>. </p>
<p>""He has preached in clubs and churches until his faith has
become familiar to us. . . . <a name=""v9_amnews""></a>His
culture, his eloquence, and his fascinating personality have given us a
<i>new idea of Hindu civilisation</i> . . . . His fine,
intelligent face and his deep musical voice, prepossessing one at once
in his favour. . . . He speaks without notes, presenting his facts and
his conclusions with the greatest art and the most convincing
sincerity, and rising often to rich inspiring eloquence."" (<i>ibid</i>.)
</p>
<p>""Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the
Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to
send missionaries to this learned nation."" <i>Herald</i>
(the greatest paper here). </p>
<p>I cease from quoting more lest you think me conceited; but
this was necessary to you who have become nearly frogs in the well and
would not see how the world is going on elsewhere. I do not mean you
personally, my noble friend, but our nation in general. </p>
<p>I am the same here as in India, only here in this highly
cultural land there is an appreciation, a sympathy which our ignorant
fools never dream of. There our people grudge us monks a crumb of
bread, here they are ready to pay one thousand rupees a lecture and
remain grateful for the instructions for ever. </p>
<p>I am appreciated by these strangers more than I was ever in
India. I can, if I will, live here all my life in the greatest luxury;
but I am a Sannyasin, and ""India, with all thy faults I love thee
still"". So I am coming back after some months, and go on sowing the
seeds of religion and progress from city to city as I was doing so
long, although amongst a people who know not what appreciation and
gratefulness are. </p>
<p>I am ashamed of my own nation when I compare their beggarly,
selfish, unappreciative, ignorant ungratefulness<!--'Volume 8 Page 328'-->
with the help, hospitality, sympathy, and respect which the Americans
have shown to me, a representative of a foreign religion. Therefore
come out of the country, see others, and compare. </p>
<p>Now after these quotations, do you think it was worth while to
send a Sannyasin to America? </p>
<p>Please do not publish it. I hate notoriety in the same manner
as I did in India. </p>
<p>I am doing the Lord's work, and wherever He leads I follow.
&#2350;&#2370;&#2325;&#2306; &#2325;&#2352;&#2379;&#2340;&#2367; &#2357;&#2366;&#2330;&#2366;&#2354;&#2306;&nbsp;etc.&#8212; He who makes the dumb eloquent
and the lame cross a mountain, He will help me. I do not care for human
help. He is ready to help me in India, in America, on the North Pole,
if He thinks fit. If He does not, none else can help me. Glory unto the
Lord for ever and ever.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>XXXIV</h2>
<p class=""right"">541 DEARBORN AVENUE, <br>
CHICAGO, <br>
<i>November</i>(?)<i>, 1894</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DIWANJI (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai), </p>
<p>Your letter pleased me extremely. I, of course, understand the
joke, but I am not the baby to be put off with a joke; now take more. </p>
<p>The secret of success of the Westerners is the power of
organisation and combination. That is only possible with mutual trust
and co-operation and help. Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain, whom
you well knew in Bombay. This man never takes anything but pure
vegetables even in this terribly cold climate, and<!--'Volume 8 Page 329'-->
tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and religion. The people
of this country like him very well, but what are they doing who sent
him over? They are trying to outcast him. Jealousy is a vice
necessarily generated in slaves. Again it is jealousy that holds them
down. </p>
<p>Here were . . .; they were all trying to lecture and get money
thereby. They did something, but I succeeded better than they &#8212; why, I
did not put myself as a bar to their success. It was the will of the
Lord. But all these . . . except . . . have fabricated and circulated
the most horrible lies about me in this country, and behind my back.
Americans will never stoop to such meanness. </p>
<p>. . . If any man tries to move forward here, everybody is
ready to help him. In India you may try tomorrow by writing a single
line of praise for me in any of our papers (Hindu), and the next day
they would be all against me. Why? It is the nature of slaves. They
cannot suffer to see any one of their brethren putting his head the
least above their rank. . . . Do you mean to compare such stuff with
these children of liberty, self-help, and brotherly love? The nearest
approach to our people are the freed slaves of the U.S.A., the Negroes.
Why, in the South they are about twenty millions and are now free. The
whites are a handful, still the whites hold them down all the same.
Why, even when they have every right by law, a bloody war between the
brothers has been fought to free these slaves? The same defect &#8212;
jealousy. Not one of these Negroes would bear to see his brother-Negro
praised or pushing on. Immediately they would join the whites to crush
him down. You can have no idea about it until you come out of India. It
is all right for those who have plenty of money and position to let the
world roll on such, but I call him a traitor who, having been educated,
nursed in luxury by the heart's blood of the downtrodden millions of
toiling poor, never<!--'Volume 8 Page 330'--> even takes a
thought for them. Where, in what period of history your rich men,
noblemen, your priests and potentates took any thought for the poor &#8212;
the grinding of whose faces is the very life-blood of their power? </p>
<p>But the Lord is great, the vengeance came sooner or later, and
they who sucked the life-blood of the poor, whose very education was at
their expense, whose very power was built on their poverty, were in
their turn sold as slaves by hundreds and thousands, their wives and
daughters dishonoured, their property robbed for the last 1,000 years,
and do you think it was for no cause? </p>
<p>Why amongst the poor of India so many are Mohammedans? It is
nonsense to say, they were converted by the sword. It was to gain their
liberty from the . . . zemindars and from the . . . priest, and as a
consequence you find in Bengal there are more Mohammedans than Hindus
amongst the cultivators, because there were so many zemindars there.
Who thinks of raising these sunken downtrodden millions? A few thousand
graduates do not make a nation, a few rich men do not make a nation.
True, our opportunities are less, but still there is enough to feed and
clothe and made 300 millions more comfortable, nay, luxurious. Ninety
per cent of our people are without education &#8212; who thinks of that? &#8212;
these Babus, the so-called patriots? </p>
<p>Now, let me tell you &#8212; still there is a God, no joke. He is
ordering our lives, and although I know a nation of slaves cannot but
try to bite at the hand that wants to give them medicine, yet, pray
with me, you &#8212; one of the few that have real sympathy for everything
good, for everything great, one at least whom I know to be a man of
true ring, nobility of nature, and a thorough sincerity of head and
heart &#8212; pray with me: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
""Lead, kindly Light, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
amid th' encircling gloom."" </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 331'-->
<p>I do not care what they say. I love my God, my religion, my
country, and above all, myself, a poor beggar. I love the poor, the
ignorant, the downtrodden, I feel for them &#8212; the Lord knows how much.
He will show me the way. I do not care a fig for human approbation or
criticism. I think of most of them as ignorant, noisy children &#8212; they

</body></html>",6582,"DEAR DIWANJI (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai),

Your letter pleased me extremely. I, of course, understand the joke, but I am not the baby to be put off with a joke; now take more.

The secret of success of the Westerners is the power of organisation and combination. That is only possible with mutual trust and co-operation and help. Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain, whom you well knew in Bombay. This man never takes anything but pure vegetables even in this terribly cold climate, andtooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and religion. The people of this country like him very well, but what are they doing who sent him over? They are trying to outcast him. Jealousy is a vice necessarily generated in slaves. Again it is jealousy that holds them down.

Here were . . .; they were all trying to lecture and get money thereby. They did something, but I succeeded better than they — why, I did not put myself as a bar to their success. It was the will of the Lord. But all these . . . except . . . have fabricated and circulated the most horrible lies about me in this country, and behind my back. Americans will never stoop to such meanness.

. . . If any man tries to move forward here, everybody is ready to help him. In India you may try tomorrow by writing a single line of praise for me in any of our papers (Hindu), and the next day they would be all against me. Why? It is the nature of slaves. They cannot suffer to see any one of their brethren putting his head the least above their rank. . . . Do you mean to compare such stuff with these children of liberty, self-help, and brotherly love? The nearest approach to our people are the freed slaves of the U.S.A., the Negroes. Why, in the South they are about twenty millions and are now free. The whites are a handful, still the whites hold them down all the same. Why, even when they have every right by law, a bloody war between the brothers has been fought to free these slaves? The same defect — jealousy. Not one of these Negroes would bear to see his brother-Negro praised or pushing on. Immediately they would join the whites to crush him down. You can have no idea about it until you come out of India. It is all right for those who have plenty of money and position to let the world roll on such, but I call him a traitor who, having been educated, nursed in luxury by the heart's blood of the downtrodden millions of toiling poor, nevereven takes a thought for them. Where, in what period of history your rich men, noblemen, your priests and potentates took any thought for the poor — the grinding of whose faces is the very life-blood of their power?

But the Lord is great, the vengeance came sooner or later, and they who sucked the life-blood of the poor, whose very education was at their expense, whose very power was built on their poverty, were in their turn sold as slaves by hundreds and thousands, their wives and daughters dishonoured, their property robbed for the last 1,000 years, and do you think it was for no cause?

Why amongst the poor of India so many are Mohammedans? It is nonsense to say, they were converted by the sword. It was to gain their liberty from the . . . zemindars and from the . . . priest, and as a consequence you find in Bengal there are more Mohammedans than Hindus amongst the cultivators, because there were so many zemindars there. Who thinks of raising these sunken downtrodden millions? A few thousand graduates do not make a nation, a few rich men do not make a nation. True, our opportunities are less, but still there is enough to feed and clothe and made 300 millions more comfortable, nay, luxurious. Ninety per cent of our people are without education — who thinks of that? — these Babus, the so-called patriots?

Now, let me tell you — still there is a God, no joke. He is ordering our lives, and although I know a nation of slaves cannot but try to bite at the hand that wants to give them medicine, yet, pray with me, you — one of the few that have real sympathy for everything good, for everything great, one at least whom I know to be a man of true ring, nobility of nature, and a thorough sincerity of head and heart — pray with me:

""Lead, kindly Light,amid th' encircling gloom.""

I do not care what they say. I love my God, my religion, my country, and above all, myself, a poor beggar. I love the poor, the ignorant, the downtrodden, I feel for them — the Lord knows how much. He will show me the way. I do not care a fig for human approbation or criticism. I think of most of them as ignorant, noisy children — they have not penetrated into the inner nature of sympathy, into the spirit which is all love.

I have that insight through the blessing of Ramakrishna. I am trying to work with my little band, all of these poor beggars like me, you have seen them. But the Lord's works have been always done by the lowly, by the poor. You bless me that I may have faith in my Guru, in my God, and in myself.

The only way is love and sympathy. The only worship is love.

May He help you and yours ever and ever!","With prayers and blessings,

<p class=""right"">54 W. 33RD STREET, <br>
NEW YORK, <br>
<i>24th April, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIEND, </p>
<p>I am perfectly aware that although some truth underlies the
mass of mystical thought which has burst upon the Western world of
late, it is for the most part full of motives, unworthy, or insane. For
this reason, I have never had anything to do with these phases of
religion, either in India or elsewhere, and mystics as a class are not
very favourable to me. . . . </p>
<p>I quite agree with you that only the Advaita philosophy can
save mankind, whether in East or West, from ""devil worship"" and kindred
superstitions, giving tone and strength to the very nature of man.
India herself requires this, quite as much or even more than the West.
Yet it is hard uphill work, for we have first to create a taste, then
teach, and lastly proceed to build up the whole fabric. </p>
<p>Perfect sincerity, holiness, gigantic intellect, and an
all-conquering will. Let only a handful of men work with these, and the
whole world will be revolutionised. I did a good deal of platform work
in this country last year, and received plenty of applause, but found
that I was only working for myself. It is the patient upbuilding of
character, the intense struggle to <i>realise</i> the
truth, which alone will tell in the future of humanity. So this year I
am hoping to work along this line &#8212; training up to practical Advaita
realisation a small band of men and women. I do not know how far I
shall succeed. The West is the field for work if a man wants to benefit
humanity, rather than his own particular sect or country. I agree
perfectly as to your idea of a magazine. But I have no<!--'Volume 8 Page 336'-->
business capacity at all to do these things. I can teach and preach,
and sometimes write. But I have intense faith in Truth. The Lord will
send help and hands to work with me. Only let me be perfectly pure,
perfectly sincere, and perfectly unselfish. </p>
<p>""Truth alone triumphs, not untruth; through truth alone

DEAR FRIEND,

I am perfectly aware that although some truth underlies the mass of mystical thought which has burst upon the Western world of late, it is for the most part full of motives, unworthy, or insane. For this reason, I have never had anything to do with these phases of religion, either in India or elsewhere, and mystics as a class are not very favourable to me. . . .

I quite agree with you that only the Advaita philosophy can save mankind, whether in East or West, from ""devil worship"" and kindred superstitions, giving tone and strength to the very nature of man. India herself requires this, quite as much or even more than the West. Yet it is hard uphill work, for we have first to create a taste, then teach, and lastly proceed to build up the whole fabric.

Perfect sincerity, holiness, gigantic intellect, and an all-conquering will. Let only a handful of men work with these, and the whole world will be revolutionised. I did a good deal of platform work in this country last year, and received plenty of applause, but found that I was only working for myself. It is the patient upbuilding of character, the intense struggle torealisethe truth, which alone will tell in the future of humanity. So this year I am hoping to work along this line — training up to practical Advaita realisation a small band of men and women. I do not know how far I shall succeed. The West is the field for work if a man wants to benefit humanity, rather than his own particular sect or country. I agree perfectly as to your idea of a magazine. But I have nobusiness capacity at all to do these things. I can teach and preach, and sometimes write. But I have intense faith in Truth. The Lord will send help and hands to work with me. Only let me be perfectly pure, perfectly sincere, and perfectly unselfish.

""Truth alone triumphs, not untruth; through truth alone stretches the way to the Lord"" (Atharva-Veda). He who gives up the little self for the world will find the whole universe his. . . . I am very uncertain about coming to England. I know no one there, and here I am doing some work. The Lord will guide, in His own time.",,,397,0,0

NEW YORK, <br>
<i>22nd June, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>The letters from India and the parcel of books reached me
safe. I am so happy to know of Mr. Sam's arrival. I am sure he is
""bewaring of the vidders"" nicely. I met a friend of Mr. Sam's one day
on the street. He is an Englishman with a name ending in ""ni"". He was
very nice. He said he was living in the same house with Sam somewhere
in Ohio. </p>
<p>I am going on pretty nearly in the same old fashion. Talking
when I can and silent when forced to be. I do not know whether I will
go to Greenacre this summer. I saw Miss Farmer the other day. She was
in a hurry to go away, so I had but very little talk with her. She is a
noble, noble lady. </p>
<p>How are you going on with your Christian Science lessons? I
hope you will go to Greenacre. There you will find quite a number of
them and also the Spiritualists, table turnings, palmists, astrologers,
etc., etc. You will get all the ""cures"" and all the ""isms"" presided
over by Miss Farmer. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 341'-->
<p>Landsberg has gone away to live in some other place, so I am
left alone. I am living mostly on nuts and fruits and milk, and find it
very nice and healthy too. I hope to lose about 30 to 40 lbs. this
summer. That will be all right for my size. I am afraid I have
forgotten all about Mrs. Adam's lessons in walking. I will have to
renew them when she comes again to N.Y. Gandhi has gone to England <i>en
route</i> to India from Boston, I suppose. </p>
<p>I would like to know about his ""chaperon"" Mrs. Howard and her
present bereaved state. I am very glad to hear that the rugs did not go
down to the bottom of the Atlantic and are at last coming. </p>
<p>This year I could hardly keep my head up, and I did not go
about lecturing. The three great commentaries on the Vedanta philosophy
belonging to the three great sects of dualists, qualified dualists, and
monists are being sent to me from India. Hope they will arrive safe.
Then I will have an intellectual feast indeed. I intend to write a book
this summer on the Vedanta philosophy. This world will always be a
mixture of good and evil, of happiness and misery; this wheel will ever
go up and come down; dissolution and resolution is the inevitable law.
Blessed are those who struggle to go beyond. Well, I am glad all the
babies are doing well but sorry there was no ""catch"" even this winter,

DEAR SISTER,

The letters from India and the parcel of books reached me safe. I am so happy to know of Mr. Sam's arrival. I am sure he is ""bewaring of the vidders"" nicely. I met a friend of Mr. Sam's one day on the street. He is an Englishman with a name ending in ""ni"". He was very nice. He said he was living in the same house with Sam somewhere in Ohio.

I am going on pretty nearly in the same old fashion. Talking when I can and silent when forced to be. I do not know whether I will go to Greenacre this summer. I saw Miss Farmer the other day. She was in a hurry to go away, so I had but very little talk with her. She is a noble, noble lady.

How are you going on with your Christian Science lessons? I hope you will go to Greenacre. There you will find quite a number of them and also the Spiritualists, table turnings, palmists, astrologers, etc., etc. You will get all the ""cures"" and all the ""isms"" presided over by Miss Farmer.

Landsberg has gone away to live in some other place, so I am left alone. I am living mostly on nuts and fruits and milk, and find it very nice and healthy too. I hope to lose about 30 to 40 lbs. this summer. That will be all right for my size. I am afraid I have forgotten all about Mrs. Adam's lessons in walking. I will have to renew them when she comes again to N.Y. Gandhi has gone to Englanden routeto India from Boston, I suppose.

I would like to know about his ""chaperon"" Mrs. Howard and her present bereaved state. I am very glad to hear that the rugs did not go down to the bottom of the Atlantic and are at last coming.

This year I could hardly keep my head up, and I did not go about lecturing. The three great commentaries on the Vedanta philosophy belonging to the three great sects of dualists, qualified dualists, and monists are being sent to me from India. Hope they will arrive safe. Then I will have an intellectual feast indeed. I intend to write a book this summer on the Vedanta philosophy. This world will always be a mixture of good and evil, of happiness and misery; this wheel will ever go up and come down; dissolution and resolution is the inevitable law. Blessed are those who struggle to go beyond. Well, I am glad all the babies are doing well but sorry there was no ""catch"" even this winter, and every winter the chances are dwindling down. Here near my lodgings is the Waldorf-Hotel, the rendezvous of lots of titled but penniless Europeans on show for ""Yankee"" heiresses to buy. You may have any selection here, the stock is so full and varied.

<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>Many thanks for the Indian mail. It brought a good deal of
good news. You are enjoying by this time, I hope, the articles by Prof.
Max Müller on the ""Immortality of the Soul"" which I sent to Mother
Church. The old man has taken in Vedanta, bones and all, and has boldly
come out. I am so glad to know the arrival of the rugs. Was there any
duty to pay? If so I will pay that, I insist on it. There will come
another big packet from the Raja of Khetri containing some shawls and
brocades and nick-nacks. I want to present them to<!--'Volume 8 Page 343'-->

I am sure. </p>
<p>I am asked again and again, as you will find in the letters
from India, to go over. They are getting desperate. Now if I go to
Europe, I will go as the guest of Mr. Francis Leggett of N.Y. He will
travel all over Germany, England, France, and Switzerland for six
weeks. From there I shall go to India, or I may return to America. I
have a seed planted here and wish it to grow. This winter's work in
N.Y. was splendid, and it may die if I suddenly go over to India, so I
am not sure about going to India soon. </p>
<p>Nothing noticeable has happened during this visit to the
Thousand Islands. The scenery is very beautiful and I have some of my
friends here with me to talk about God and soul <i>ad libitum</i>.
I am eating fruits and drinking milk and so forth, and studying huge
Sanskrit books on Vedanta which they have kindly sent me from India. </p>
<p>If I come to Chicago I cannot come at least within six weeks
or more. Baby needn't alter any of her plans for me. I will see you all
somehow or other before I go. </p>
<p>You fussed so much over my reply to Madras, but it has
produced a tremendous effect there. A late speech by the President of
the Madras Christian College, Mr. Miller, embodies a large amount of my
ideas and declares that the West is in need of Hindu ideas of God and
man and calls upon the young men to go and preach to the West. This has
created quite a furore of course amongst the Missions. What you allude
to as being published in the <i>Arena</i> I did not see a
bit of it. The women did not make any fuss over me at all in New York.
Your friend must have drawn on his imagination. They were not of the
""bossing"" type at all. I hope Father Pope will go to Europe and Mother

<p>Many thanks for the Indian mail. I cannot express in words my
gratitude to you. As you have already read<!--'Volume 8 Page 345'-->
in Max Müller's article on Immortality I sent Mother Church, that he
thinks that those we love in this life we must have loved in the past,
so it seems I must have belonged to the Holy Family in some past life.
I am expecting some books from India. I hope they have arrived. If so,
will you kindly send them over here? If any postage is due I shall send
it as soon as I get intimation. You did not write about the duty on the
rugs; there will be another big packet from Khetri containing carpets
and shawls and some brocades and other nick-nacks. I have written them
to get the duty paid there if it is possible through the American
Consul in Bombay. If not I shall have to pay it here. I do not think
they will arrive for some months yet. I am anxious about the books.
Kindly send them as soon as they arrive. </p>
<p>My love to Mother and Father Pope and all the sisters. I am
enjoying this place immensely. Very little eating and good deal of
thinking and talking and study. A wonderful calmness is coming over my
soul. Every day I feel I have no duty to do; I am always in eternal
rest and peace. It is He that works. We are only the instruments.
Blessed be His name! The threefold bondage of lust and gold and fame
is, as it were, fallen from me for the time being, and once more, even
here, I feel what sometimes I felt in India, ""From me all difference
has fallen, all right or wrong, all delusion and ignorance has
vanished, I am walking in the path beyond the qualities."" What law I
obey, what disobey? From that height the universe looks like a

<p class=""right"">19, WEST 38TH STREET, <br>
NEW YORK, <br>
<i>9th August, 1895</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIEND, </p>
<p>. . . It is only just that I should try to give you a little
of my views. I fully believe that there are periodic ferments of
religion in human society, and that such a period is now sweeping over
the educated world. While each ferment, moreover, appears broken into
various little bubbles, these are all eventually similar, showing the
cause or causes behind them to be the same. That religious ferment
which at present is every day gaining a greater hold over thinking men,
has this characteristic that all the little thought-whirlpools into
which it has broken itself declare one single aim &#8212; a vision and a
search after the Unity of Being. On planes physical, ethical, and
spiritual, an ever-broadening generalisation &#8212; leading up to a concept

struggling for the mastery. All these represent Advaita thought more or
less, and that series, which is spreading most rapidly, approaches

the lifelong struggle not to talk alone, but to <i>live the life</i>.

DEAR FRIEND,

. . . It is only just that I should try to give you a little of my views. I fully believe that there are periodic ferments of religion in human society, and that such a period is now sweeping over the educated world. While each ferment, moreover, appears broken into various little bubbles, these are all eventually similar, showing the cause or causes behind them to be the same. That religious ferment which at present is every day gaining a greater hold over thinking men, has this characteristic that all the little thought-whirlpools into which it has broken itself declare one single aim — a vision and a search after the Unity of Being. On planes physical, ethical, and spiritual, an ever-broadening generalisation — leading up to a concept of Unity Eternal — is in the air; and this being so, all the movements of the time may be taken to represent, knowingly or unknowingly, the noblest philosophy of the unity man ever had — the Advaita Vedanta.

Again, it has always been observed that as a result of the struggles of the various fragments of thought in a given epoch, one bubble survives. The rest only arise to melt into it and form a single great wave, which sweeps over society with irresistible force.

In India, America, and England (the countries Ihappen to know about) hundreds of these are struggling at the present moment. In India, dualistic formulae are already on the wane, the Advaita alone holds the field in force. In America, many movements are struggling for the mastery. All these represent Advaita thought more or less, and that series, which is spreading most rapidly, approaches nearer to it than any of the others. Now if anything was ever clear to me, it is that one of these must survive, swallowing up all the rest, to be the power of the future. Which is it to be?

Referring to history, we see that only that fragment which is fit will survive, and what makes fit to survive butcharacter? Advaita will be the future religion of thinking humanity. No doubt of that. And of all the sects, they alone shall gain the day who are able to show most character in their lives, no matter how far they may be.

<p>DEAR KALI, </p>
<p>You may have got my earlier letter. At present send all
letters to me at the above address. Mr. Sturdy is known to Târakdâ. He
has brought me to his place, and we are both trying to create a stir in
England. I shall this year leave again in November for America. So I
require a man well-up in Sanskrit and English, particularly the latter
language &#8212; either Shashi or you or Sâradâ. Now, if you have completely
recovered, very well, you come; otherwise send Sharat. The work is to
teach the devotees I shall be leaving here, to make them study the
Vedanta, to do a little translation work into English, and to deliver
occasional lectures. ""Work is apt to cloud spiritual vision."" X__ is
very eager to come, but unless the foundation is strongly laid, there
is every likelihood of everything toppling down. I am sending you a
cheque along with this letter. Buy clothes and other necessary things &#8212;
whoever comes. I am sending the cheque in the name of Master Mahashay
Mahendra Babu. Gangâdhar's Tibetan <i>choga</i> is in the
Math; get the tailor to make a similar <i>choga</i> of
gerua colour. See that the collar is a little high, that is, the throat
and neck should be covered. . . . Above all, you must have a woolen
overcoat, for it is very cold. If you do not put on an overcoat on the
ship, you will suffer much. . . . I am sending a second class ticket,
as there is not much difference between a first class and a second
class berth. . . . If it is decided to send Shashi then inform the
purser of the<!--'Volume 8 Page 353'--> ship beforehand to
provide him with vegetarian diet. </p>
<p>Go to Bombay and see Messrs. King, King &amp; Co., Fort,
Bombay, and tell them that you are Mr. Sturdy's man. They will then
give you a ticket to England. A letter is being sent from here to the
Company with instructions. I am writing to the Maharaja of Khetri to
instruct his Bombay agent to look after the booking of your passage. If
this sum of Rs. 150/- is not sufficient for your outfit, get the
remainder from Rakhal. I shall send him the amount afterwards. Keep
another Rs. 50/- for pocket expenses &#8212; take it from Rakhal; I shall pay
back later. I have not up to now got any acknowledgement of the amount
I sent to Chuni Babu. Start as quickly as possible. Inform Mahendra
Babu that he is my Calcutta agent. Tell him to send a letter to Mr.
Sturdy by next mail informing him that he is ready to look after all
business transactions in Calcutta on your behalf. In effect, Mr. Sturdy
is my secretary in England, Mahendra Babu in Calcutta, and Alasinga in
Madras. Send this information to Madras also. Can any work be done
unless all of us gird up our loins? And be up and doing! ""Fortune
favours the brave and energetic."" Don't look back &#8212; forward, infinite
energy, infinite enthusiasm, infinite daring, and infinite patience &#8212;
then alone can great deeds be accomplished. We must set the whole world
afire. </p>
<p>Now on the day the steamer is due to start, write a letter to
Mr. Sturdy informing him by which steamer you are leaving for England.
Otherwise there is some likelihood of your having difficulties when you
reach London. Take the ship that comes directly to London, for even if
it takes a few days longer on the voyage, the fares are less. At the
moment our purse is lean. In time we shall send preachers in large
numbers to all the quarters of the globe.</p>

DEAR JOE JOE,

I was so glad to hear from you. I was afraid you had forgotten me.

I am going to have a few lectures in and about London. One of them, a public one, will be at Princes' Hall on the 22nd at 8-30.

Come over and try to form a class. I have as yet done almost nothing here. Of course, breaking the ice is slow always. It took me two years in America to work up that little which we had in New York.

<p>One is an Engineer and the other is in the grain trade. They

educated men. One has given up the Church, the other asked me whether
he should or not. Now, two things struck me after this interview.
First, we must hurry the book through. We will touch a class thereby
who are philosophically religious without the least mystery-mongering.
Second, both of them want to know the rituals of my creed! This opened
my eyes. The world in general must have some form. In fact, in the
ordinary sense religion is philosophy concretised through rituals and
symbols. </p>
<p>It is absolutely necessary to form some ritual and have a
Church. That is to say, we must fix on some ritual as fast as we can.
If you can come Saturday morning or<!--'Volume 8 Page 357'-->
sooner, we shall go to the Asiatic Society library or you can procure
for me a book which is called <i>Hemâdri Kosha</i>, from
which we can get what we want, and kindly bring the Upanishads. We will
fix something grand, from birth to death of a man. A mere loose system
of philosophy gets no hold on mankind. </p>
<p>If we can get it through, before we have finished the classes,
and publish it by publicly holding a service or two under it, it will
go on. They want to form a congregation, and they want ritual; that is
one of the causes why &#8212; will never have a hold on Western people. </p>
<p>The Ethical Society has sent me another letter thanking me for
the acceptance of this offer. Also a copy of their forms. They want me
to bring with me a book from which to read for ten minutes. Will you

DEAR JOE JOE,

After 10 days of the most disastrous voyage I ever had I arrived in New York. I was so so sick for days together.

Your bundles have been safely delivered to the heavenly pair, as Alberta calls them. They are as usual very kind. Saw Mrs. and Mr. Salomon and other friends.

<p>The work here is going on splendidly. I have been working
incessantly at two classes a day since my arrival. Tomorrow I go out of
town with Mr. Leggett for a week's holiday. Did you know Madame
Antoinette Sterling, one of your greatest singers? She is very much

<p>. . . What about the <i>Nârada-Sutra</i>? There
will be a good sale of the book here, I am sure. I have now taken up
the <i>Yoga-Sutras</i> and take them up one by one and go
through all the commentators along with them. These talks are all taken
down, and when completed will form the fullest annotated translation of
Patanjali in English. Of course it will be rather a big work. </p>
<p>At Trübner's I think there is an edition of <i>Kurma
Purâna</i>. The commentator, Vijnâna Bhikshu, is continually
quoting from that book. I have never seen the book myself. Will you
kindly find time to go and see if in it there are some chapters on
Yoga? If so, will you kindly send me a copy? Also of the <i>Hatha-Yoga-Pradipikâ</i>,
<i>Shiva-Samhitâ</i>, and any other book on Yoga? The
originals of course. I shall send you the money for them as soon as
they arrive. Also a copy of <i>Sânkhya-Kârikâ</i> of
Ishwara Krishna by John Davies. Just now your letter reached along with
Indian letters. The one man who<!--'Volume 8 Page 362'-->
is ready is ill. The others say that they cannot come over on the spur
of the moment. So far it seems unlucky. I am sorry they could not come.
What can be done? Things go slow in India! </p>
<p>Ramanuja's theory is that the bound soul or Jiva has its
perfections involved, entered, into itself. When this perfection again
evolves, it becomes free. The Advaitin declares both these to take
place only in show; there was neither involution nor evolution. Both
processes were Maya, or <i>apparent</i> only. </p>
<p>In the first place, the soul is not <i>essentially a
knowing</i> being. <i>Sachchidânanda</i> is only an
approximate definition, and <i>Neti Neti</i> is the
essential definition. Schopenhauer caught this idea of willing from the
Buddhists. We have it also in <i>Vâsanâ</i> or <i>Trishnâ</i>,
Pali <i>tanhâ</i>. We also admit that it is the <i>cause</i>
of all manifestation which are, in their turn, its effects. But, being
a cause, it must be a combination of the <i>Absolute</i>
and <i>Maya</i>. Even knowledge, being a compound, cannot
be the Absolute itself, but it is the nearest approach to it, and
higher than <i>Vasana</i>, conscious or unconscious. The
Absolute first becomes the mixture of knowledge, then, in the second
degree, that of will. If it be said that plants have no consciousness,
that they are at best only unconscious wills, the answer is that even
the <i>unconscious plant-will</i> is a manifestation of
the consciousness, not of the plant, but of the cosmos, the Mahat of
the Sankhya Philosophy. The Buddhist analysis of everything into will
is imperfect, firstly, because will is itself a compound, and secondly,
because consciousness or knowledge which is a compound of the first
degree, precedes it. <i>Knowledge is action</i>. <i>First
action, then reaction</i>. When the mind perceives, then, as the
reaction, it <i>wills</i>. The will is in the mind. So it
is absurd to say that will is the last analysis. Deussen is playing
into the hands of the Darwinists. </p>

But evolution must be brought in accordance with the more exact science

cosmic consciousness. (See also Vol VIII <a href=""../sayings_and_utterances.htm#v5_epi_057"">Sayings and

<p>DEAR SHARAT, </p>
<p>Your letter only made me sad. I see you have lost all
enthusiasm. I know all of you, your powers and your limitations. I
would not have called you to any task which you are incompetent to do.
The only task I would have given you was to teach elementary Sanskrit,
and with the help of dictionaries and other things assist S. in his
translations and teachings. I would have moulded you to it. Anyone
could have done as well &#8212; only a little smattering of Sanskrit was
absolutely necessary. Well, everything is for the best. If it is the
Lord's work the right man for the right place will be forthcoming in
the right time. None of you need feel disturbed. As for Sanyal, I don't
care who takes money or not, but I have a strong hatred for
child-marriage. I have suffered terribly from it, and it is the great
sin for which our nation has to suffer. As such, I would hate myself if
I help such a diabolical custom directly or indirectly. I wrote to you
pretty plain about it, and Sanyal had no right to play a hoax upon me
about his ""law-suit"" and his attempts to<!--'Volume 8 Page 366'-->
become free. I am sorry for his playing tricks on me who have never
done him any harm. This is the world. What good you do goes for
nothing, but if you stop doing it, then, Lord help you, you are counted
as a rogue. Isn't it? Emotional natures like mine are always preyed
upon by relatives and friends. This world is merciless. This world is
our friend when we are its slaves and no more. This world is broad
enough for me. There will always be a corner found for me somewhere. If
the people of India do not like me, there will be others who do. I must
set my foot to the best of my ability upon this devilish custom of
child-marriage. No blame will entail on you. You keep at a safe
distance if you are afraid. I am sorry, very sorry, I cannot have any
partnership with such doings as getting husbands for babies. Lord help
me, I never had and never will have. Think of the case of M__ Babu! Did
you ever meet a more cowardly or brutal one than that? I can kill the
man who gets a husband for a baby. The upshot of the whole thing is &#8212; I
want bold, daring, adventurous spirits to help me. Else I will work
alone. I have a mission to fulfil. I will work it out alone. I do not
care who comes or who goes. Sanyal is already done for by Samsâra.
Beware, boy! That was all the advice I thought it my duty to give you.
Of course, you are great folks now &#8212; my words will have no value with
you. But I hope the time will come when you will see clearer, know
better, and think other thoughts than you are now doing. </p>
<p>Good-bye! I would not bother you any more, and all blessings
go with you all. I am very glad I have been of some service to you
sometimes if you think so. At least I am pleased with myself for having
tried my best to discharge the duties laid on me by my Guru, and well
done or ill, I am glad that I tried. So good-bye. Tell Sanyal that I am
not at all angry with him, but I am sorry, very sorry. It is not the
money &#8212; that counts nothing &#8212;<!--'Volume 8 Page 367'-->
but the violation of a principle that pained me, and the trick he
played on me. Good-bye to him also, and to you all. One chapter of my
life is closed. Let others come in their due order. They will find me
ready. You need not disturb yourselves at all about me. I want no help
from any human being in any country. So good-bye! May the Lord bless
you all for ever and ever! </p>

I do not care who comes or who goes. Sanyal is already done for by Samsâra. Beware, boy! That was all the advice I thought it my duty to give you. Of course, you are great folks now — my words will have no value with you. But I hope the time will come when you will see clearer, know better, and think other thoughts than you are now doing.

Good-bye! I would not bother you any more, and all blessings go with you all. I am very glad I have been of some service to you sometimes if you think so. At least I am pleased with myself for having tried my best to discharge the duties laid on me by my Guru, and well done or ill, I am glad that I tried. So good-bye. Tell Sanyal that I am not at all angry with him, but I am sorry, very sorry. It is not the money — that counts nothing —but the violation of a principle that pained me, and the trick he played on me. Good-bye to him also, and to you all. One chapter of my life is closed. Let others come in their due order. They will find me ready. You need not disturb yourselves at all about me. I want no help from any human being in any country. So good-bye! May the Lord bless you all for ever and ever!",VIVEKANANDA.,,678,1,0

<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind New Year's greetings. I am glad to
learn you enjoyed your six weeks with the Esq. although they be only
golf playing. I have been in the midst of the genuine article in
England. The English people received me with open arms, and I have very
much toned down my ideas about the English race. First of all, I found
that those fellows as Lund etc. who came over from England to attack me
were nowhere. Their existence is simply ignored by the English people.
None but a person belonging to the English Church is thought to be <i>genteel</i>.
Again, some of the best men of England belonging to the English Church
and some of the highest in position and fame became my truest friends.
This was quite another sort of experience from what I met in America,
was it not? </p>
<p>The English people laughed and laughed when I told them about
my experience with the Presbyterians and other fanatics here and my
reception in hotels etc. I also found at once the difference in culture
and breeding between the two countries and came to understand why
American girls go in shoals to be married to Europeans. Everyone was
kind to me there, and I have left many noble friends of both sexes
anxiously waiting my return in the spring. </p>
<p>As to my work there, the Vedantic thought has already
permeated the higher classes of England. Many<!--'Volume 8 Page 369'-->
people of education and rank, and amongst them not a few clergymen,
told me that the conquest of Rome by Greece was being re-enacted in
England. </p>
<p>There are two sorts of Englishmen who have lived in India. One
consisting of those who hate everything Indian, but they are
uneducated. The other, to whom India is the holy land, its very air is
holy. And they try to out-Herod Herod in their Hinduism. They are awful
vegetarians, and they want to form a caste in England. Of course, the
majority of the English people are firm believers in caste. I had eight
classes a week apart from public lectures, and they were so crowded
that a good many people, even ladies of high rank, sat on the floor and
did not think anything of it. In England I find strong-minded men and
women to take up the work and carry it forward with the peculiar
English grip and energy. This year my work in New York is going on
splendidly. Mr. Leggett is a very rich man of New York and very much
interested in me. The New Yorker has more steadiness than any other
people in this country, so I have determined to make my centre here. In
this country my teachings are thought to be queer by the ""Methodist""
and ""Presbyterian"" aristocracy. In England it is the highest philosophy
to the English Church aristocracy. </p>
<p>Moreover those talks and gossips, so characteristic of the
American woman, are almost unknown in England. The English woman is
slow; but when she works up to an idea, she will have a hold on it
sure; and they are regularly carrying on my work there and sending
every week a report &#8212; think of that! Here is I go away for a week,
everything falls to pieces. My love to all &#8212; to Sam and to yourself.

<p>Many many thanks for the books. The <i>Sankhya Karika</i>
is a very good book, and the <i>Kurma Purana</i>, though I
do not find in it all expected, has a few verses on Yoga. The words
dropped in my last letter were <i>Yoga-Sutra</i>, which I
am translating with notes from various authorities. I want to
incorporate the chapter in <i>Kurma Purana</i> in my
notes. I have very enthusiastic accounts of your classes from Miss
MacLeod. Mr. Galsworthy seems to be very much interested now. </p>
<p>I have begun my Sunday lectures here and also the classes.
Both are very enthusiastically received. I make them all free and take
up a collection to pay the hall etc. Last Sunday's lecture was very
much appreciated and is in the press. I shall send you a few copies
next week. It was the outline of our work. </p>
<p>As my friends have engaged a stenographer (Goodwin), all these
class lessons and public lectures are taken down. I intend to send you
a copy of each. They may suggest you some ideas. </p>
<p>My great want here is a strong man like you, possessing
intellect, and ability, and love. In this nation of universal
education, all seem to melt down into a mediocrity, and the few able
are weighed down by the eternal money-making. </p>
<p>I have a chance of getting a piece of land in the country, and
some buildings on it, plenty of trees and a river, to serve as a summer
meditation resort. That, of course, requires a committee to look after
it in my absence, as also the handling of money and printing and other
matters. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 371'-->
<p>I have separated myself entirely from money questions, yet
without it the movement cannot go on. So necessarily I have to make
over everything executive to a committee, which will look after these
things in my absence. Steady work is not in the line of the Americans.
The only way they work, is in a herd. So let them have it. As to the
teaching part, my friends will go over this country from place to
place, each one independent, and let them form independent circles.
That is the easiest way to spread. Then, when there will be sufficient

yourselves up. Why, you get in a notice of the Theosophists' lectures

Theosophists will spoil my work both in America and England, and well
it may. They are thought by all people of sound mind to be wrong, and
true it is that they are held so, and you know it full well. I am
afraid you want to overreach me. You think you can get more subscribers

<!--'Volume 8 Page 372'-->
<p>I do not want to quarrel with the Theosophists, but my
position is entirely ignoring them. Had they paid for the
advertisement? Why should you go forward to advertise them? I shall get
more than enough subscribers in England when I go next. </p>
<p>Now, I would have no traitors, I tell you plainly, I would not
be played upon by any rogue. No hypocrisy with me. Hoist your flag and
give public notice in your paper that you have given up all connections
with me, and join the . . . camp of the Theosophists or cease to have
anything whatsoever to do with them. I give you very plain words
indeed. I shall have one man only to follow me, but he must be true and
faithful unto death. I do not care for success or no success. I am
tired of this nonsense of preaching all over the world. Did any of

BLESSED AND BELOVED,

I am coming before May if possible. You need notworry about that. The pamphlet was beautiful. The newspaper cuttings from here will be forwarded if we can get them.

The books and pamphlets here have been got up this way. A committee was formed in New York. They paid all the expenses of stenographing and printing on condition the books will belong to them. So these pamphlets and books are theirs. One book, theKarma-Yogahas been already published; theRaja-Yoga, a much bigger one, is in the course of publication; theJnana-Yogamay be published later on. These will be popular books, the language being that of talk, as you have seen already. I have purged everything that is objectionable, and they help me in getting up the books.

The books are the property of this Committee, of which Mrs. Ole Bull is the principal backer, also Mrs. Leggett.

It is only just that they should have the books as they paid all the expenses. There is no fear of the publishers meddling with them, as they are the publishers themselves.

If any books come from India please keep them.

The stenographer, who is an Englishman named Goodwin, has become so interested in the work that I have now made him a Brahmachârin, and he is going round with me, and we shall come over together to England. He will be very helpful as he has been always.","Yours with all blessings,

LONDON, S.W., <br>
<i>30th May, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>Your letter reached just now. Of course, you were not jealous
but all of a sudden were inspired with sympathy for poor India. Well,
you need not be frightened. Wrote a letter to Mother Church weeks ago,
but have not been able to get a line from her yet. I am afraid the
whole party have taken orders and entered a Catholic convent &#8212; four old
maids are enough to drive any mother to a convent. I had a beautiful
visit with Prof. Max Müller. He is a saint &#8212; a Vedantist through and
through. What think you? He has been a devoted admirer of my old Master
for years. He has written an article on my Master in <i>The
Nineteenth Century</i>, which will soon come out. We had long
talk on Indian things. I wish I had half his love for India. We are
going to start another little magazine here. What about The <i>Brahmavadin</i>?
Are you pushing it? If four pushful old maids cannot push a journal, I
am blowed. You will hear from me now and then. I am not a pin to be
lost under a bushel. I am having classes here just now. I begin Sunday

We have rented it for the season. Last night I made a dish. It was such
a delicious mixture of saffron, lavender, mace, nutmeg, cubebs,
cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, cream, limejuice, onions, raisins, almonds,
pepper, and rice, that I myself could not eat it. There was no
asafoetida, though that would have made it smoother to swallow. </p>

DEAR MARY,

Your letter reached just now. Of course, you were not jealous but all of a sudden were inspired with sympathy for poor India. Well, you need not be frightened. Wrote a letter to Mother Church weeks ago, but have not been able to get a line from her yet. I am afraid the whole party have taken orders and entered a Catholic convent — four old maids are enough to drive any mother to a convent. I had a beautiful visit with Prof. Max Müller. He is a saint — a Vedantist through and through. What think you? He has been a devoted admirer of my old Master for years. He has written an article on my Master inThe Nineteenth Century, which will soon come out. We had long talk on Indian things. I wish I had half his love for India. We are going to start another little magazine here. What about TheBrahmavadin? Are you pushing it? If four pushful old maids cannot push a journal, I am blowed. You will hear from me now and then. I am not a pin to be lost under a bushel. I am having classes here just now. I begin Sunday lectures from next week. The classes are very big and are in the house. We have rented it for the season. Last night I made a dish. It was such a delicious mixture of saffron, lavender, mace, nutmeg, cubebs, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, cream, limejuice, onions, raisins, almonds, pepper, and rice, that I myself could not eat it. There was no asafoetida, though that would have made it smoother to swallow.

India. I have sent him to the U.S.A. and sent for another from India.
The season is closed; the classes, therefore, and the Sunday lectures
are to be closed on the 16th next. And on the 19th I go for a month or
so for quiet and rest in the Swiss Mountains to return next autumn to
London and begin again. The work here has been very satisfactory. By
rousing interest here I really do more for India than in India. Mother
wrote to me that if you could rent your flat, she would be glad to take
you with her to see Egypt. I am going with three English friends to the
Swiss Hills. Later on, towards the end of winter, I expect to go to
India with some English friends who are going to live in my monastery

<h2>LXXXI</h2>
<p class=""center""><i>To Mr. J. J. Goodwin</i></p>
<p class=""right"">SWITZERLAND, <br>
<i>8th August, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR GOODWIN, </p>
<p>I am now taking rest. I read from different letters a lot
about Kripananda. I am sorry for him. There must be something wrong in
his head. Let him alone. None of you need bother about him. </p>
<p>As for hurting me, that is not in the power of gods or devils.
So be at rest. It is unswerving love and perfect unselfishness that
conquer everything. We Vedantists in every difficulty ought to ask the
subjective question, ""Why do I see that?"" ""Why can I not conquer this
with love?"" </p>
<p>I am very glad at the reception the Swami has met with, also
at the good work he is doing. Great work requires great and persistent
effort for a long time. Neither need we trouble ourselves if a few
fail. It is in the nature of things that many should fall, that
troubles should come, that tremendous difficulties should arise, that
selfishness and all the other devils in the human heart should struggle
hard when they are about to be driven out by the fire of spirituality.
The road to the Good is the roughest and steepest in the universe. It
is a wonder that so many succeed, no wonder that so many fall.
Character has to be established through a thousand stumbles. </p>
<p>I am much refreshed now. I look out of the window and see the
huge glaciers just before me and feel that I am in the Himalayas. I am
quite calm. My nerves have regained their accustomed strength; and
little vexations, like those you write of, do not touch me at all. How
shall I be disturbed by this child's play? The whole world<!--'Volume 8 Page 384'-->
is a mere child's play &#8212; preaching, teaching, and all included. ""Know
him to be the Sannyasin who neither hates not desires"" (Gita, V.3). And
what is there to be desired in this little mud-puddle of a world, with
its ever-recurring misery, disease, and death? ""He who has given up all
desires, he alone is happy."" </p>
<p>This rest, eternal, peaceful rest, I am catching a glimpse of
now in this beautiful spot. ""Having once known that the Atman alone,
and nothing else, exists, desiring what, or for whose desire, shall you
suffer misery about the body?"" (Brihadâranyaka, IV. iv. 12.) </p>
<p>I feel as if I had my share of experience in what they call
""work"". I am finished, I am longing now to get out. ""Out of thousands,
but one strives to attain the Goal. And even of those who struggle
hard, but few attain"" (Gita, VII. 3); for the senses are powerful, they
drag men down. </p>
<p>""A good world"", ""a happy world"", and ""social progress"", are
all terms equally intelligible with ""hot ice"" or ""dark light"". If it
were good, it would not be the world. The soul foolishly thinks of
manifesting the Infinite in finite matter, Intelligence through gross
particles; but at last it finds out its error and tries to escape. This
going-back is the beginning of religion, and its method, destruction of
self, that is, love. Not love for wife or child or anybody else, but
love for everything else except this little self. Never be deluded by
the tall talk, of which you will hear so much in America, about ""human
progress"" and such stuff. There is <i>no progress</i>
without corresponding digression. In one society there is one set of
evils; in another, another. So with periods of history. In the Middle
Ages, there were more robbers, now more cheats. At one period there is
less idea of married life; at another, more prostitution. In one, more
physical agony; in another, a thousandfold more mental. So with
knowledge. Did not gravitation<!--'Volume 8 Page 385'-->
already exist in nature before it was observed and named? Then what
difference does it make to know that it exists? Are you happier than
the Red Indians? </p>
<p>The only knowledge that is of any value is to know that all
this is humbug. But few, very few, will ever know this. ""Know the Atman
alone, and give up all other vain words."" This is the only knowledge we
gain from all this knocking about the universe. This is the only work,
to call upon mankind to ""Awake, arise, and stop not till the goal is
reached"". It is renunciation, Tyâga, that is meant by religion, and
nothing else. </p>
<p>Ishwara is the sum total of individuals; yet He Himself also
is an individual in the same way as the human body is a unit, of which
each cell is an individual. Samashti or the Collective is God. Vyashti
or the component is the soul of Jiva. The existence of Ishwara,
therefore, depends on that of Jiva, as the body on the cell, and vice
versa. Jiva, and Ishwara are co-existent beings. As long as the one
exists, the other also must. Again, since in all the higher spheres,
except on our earth, the amount of good is vastly in excess of the
amount of bad, the sum total or Ishwara may be said to be All-good,
Almighty, and Omniscient. These are obvious qualities, and need no
argument to prove, from the very fact of totality. </p>
<p>Brahman is beyond both of these, and is not a state. It is the
only unit not composed of many units. It is the principle which runs
through all, from a cell to God, and without which nothing can exist.
Whatever is real is that principle or Brahman. When I think ""I am
Brahman"", then I alone exist. It is so also when <i>you</i>
so think, and so on. Each one is the whole of that principle. . . . </p>
<p>A few days ago, I felt a sudden irresistible desire to write
to Kripananda. Perhaps he was unhappy and thinking of me. So I wrote
him a warm letter. Today<!--'Volume 8 Page 386'--> from
the American news, I see why it was so. I sent him flowers gathered

DEAR GOODWIN,

I am now taking rest. I read from different letters a lot about Kripananda. I am sorry for him. There must be something wrong in his head. Let him alone. None of you need bother about him.

As for hurting me, that is not in the power of gods or devils. So be at rest. It is unswerving love and perfect unselfishness that conquer everything. We Vedantists in every difficulty ought to ask the subjective question, ""Why do I see that?"" ""Why can I not conquer this with love?""

I am very glad at the reception the Swami has met with, also at the good work he is doing. Great work requires great and persistent effort for a long time. Neither need we trouble ourselves if a few fail. It is in the nature of things that many should fall, that troubles should come, that tremendous difficulties should arise, that selfishness and all the other devils in the human heart should struggle hard when they are about to be driven out by the fire of spirituality. The road to the Good is the roughest and steepest in the universe. It is a wonder that so many succeed, no wonder that so many fall. Character has to be established through a thousand stumbles.

I am much refreshed now. I look out of the window and see the huge glaciers just before me and feel that I am in the Himalayas. I am quite calm. My nerves have regained their accustomed strength; and little vexations, like those you write of, do not touch me at all. How shall I be disturbed by this child's play? The whole worldis a mere child's play — preaching, teaching, and all included. ""Know him to be the Sannyasin who neither hates not desires"" (Gita, V.3). And what is there to be desired in this little mud-puddle of a world, with its ever-recurring misery, disease, and death? ""He who has given up all desires, he alone is happy.""

This rest, eternal, peaceful rest, I am catching a glimpse of now in this beautiful spot. ""Having once known that the Atman alone, and nothing else, exists, desiring what, or for whose desire, shall you suffer misery about the body?"" (Brihadâranyaka, IV. iv. 12.)

I feel as if I had my share of experience in what they call ""work"". I am finished, I am longing now to get out. ""Out of thousands, but one strives to attain the Goal. And even of those who struggle hard, but few attain"" (Gita, VII. 3); for the senses are powerful, they drag men down.

""A good world"", ""a happy world"", and ""social progress"", are all terms equally intelligible with ""hot ice"" or ""dark light"". If it were good, it would not be the world. The soul foolishly thinks of manifesting the Infinite in finite matter, Intelligence through gross particles; but at last it finds out its error and tries to escape. This going-back is the beginning of religion, and its method, destruction of self, that is, love. Not love for wife or child or anybody else, but love for everything else except this little self. Never be deluded by the tall talk, of which you will hear so much in America, about ""human progress"" and such stuff. There isno progresswithout corresponding digression. In one society there is one set of evils; in another, another. So with periods of history. In the Middle Ages, there were more robbers, now more cheats. At one period there is less idea of married life; at another, more prostitution. In one, more physical agony; in another, a thousandfold more mental. So with knowledge. Did not gravitationalready exist in nature before it was observed and named? Then what difference does it make to know that it exists? Are you happier than the Red Indians?

The only knowledge that is of any value is to know that all this is humbug. But few, very few, will ever know this. ""Know the Atman alone, and give up all other vain words."" This is the only knowledge we gain from all this knocking about the universe. This is the only work, to call upon mankind to ""Awake, arise, and stop not till the goal is reached"". It is renunciation, Tyâga, that is meant by religion, and nothing else.

Ishwara is the sum total of individuals; yet He Himself also is an individual in the same way as the human body is a unit, of which each cell is an individual. Samashti or the Collective is God. Vyashti or the component is the soul of Jiva. The existence of Ishwara, therefore, depends on that of Jiva, as the body on the cell, and vice versa. Jiva, and Ishwara are co-existent beings. As long as the one exists, the other also must. Again, since in all the higher spheres, except on our earth, the amount of good is vastly in excess of the amount of bad, the sum total or Ishwara may be said to be All-good, Almighty, and Omniscient. These are obvious qualities, and need no argument to prove, from the very fact of totality.

Brahman is beyond both of these, and is not a state. It is the only unit not composed of many units. It is the principle which runs through all, from a cell to God, and without which nothing can exist. Whatever is real is that principle or Brahman. When I think ""I am Brahman"", then I alone exist. It is so also whenyouso think, and so on. Each one is the whole of that principle. . . .

A few days ago, I felt a sudden irresistible desire to write to Kripananda. Perhaps he was unhappy and thinking of me. So I wrote him a warm letter. Todayfrom the American news, I see why it was so. I sent him flowers gathered near the glaciers. Ask Miss Waldo to send him some money and plenty of love. Love never dies. The love of the father never dies, whatever the children may do or be. He is my child. He has the same or more share in my love and help, now that he is in misery.","Yours with blessings,

<p class=""center""><i>To Miss Mary Hale</i></p>
<p class=""right"">AIRLIE LODGE, RIDGEWAY GARDENS, <br>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, <br>
<i>17th September, 1896</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR SISTER, </p>
<p>Today I reached London, after my two months of climbing and
walking and glacier seeing in Switzerland. One good it has done me &#8212; a
few pounds of unnecessary adipose tissue have returned back to the
gaseous state. Well, there is no safety even in that, for the solid
body of this birth has taken a fancy to outstrip the mind towards
infinite expansion. If it goes on this way, I would have soon to lose
all personal identity even in the flesh &#8212; at least to all the rest of
the world. </p>
<p>It is impossible to express my joy in words at the good news
contained in Harriet's letter. I have written to her today. I am sorry
I cannot come over to see her married, but I will be present in ""fine
body"" with all good wishes and blessings. Well, I am expecting such
news from you and other sisters to make my joy complete. Now, my dear
Mary, I will tell you a great lesson I have learnt in this life. It is
this: ""The higher is your ideal, the more miserable you are""; for such
a thing as an ideal <i>cannot</i> be attained <i>in
the world</i>, or in this life even. He who wants perfection in
the world is a madman, for it cannot be. </p>
<p>How can you find the Infinite in the finite? Therefore I tell
you, Harriet will have a most blessed and happy life, because she is
not so imaginative and sentimental as to make a fool of herself. She
has enough of sentiment as to make life sweet, and enough of common
sense and gentleness as to soften the hard points in<!--'Volume 8 Page 390'-->
life which must come to everyone. So has Harriet McKindley in a still
higher degree. She is just the girl to make the best of wives, only
this world is so full of idiots that very few can penetrate beyond the
flesh! As for you and Isabelle, I will tell you the truth, and my
""language is plain"". </p>
<p>You, Mary, are like a mettlesome Arab &#8212; grand, splendid. You
will make a splendid queen &#8212; physically, mentally. You will shine
alongside of a dashing, bold, adventurous, heroic husband; but, my dear
sister, you will make one of the worst of wives. You will take the life
out of our easy-going, practical, plodding husbands of the everyday
world. Mind, my sister, although it is true that there is more romance
in actual life than in any novel, yet it is few and far between.
Therefore my advice to you is that until you bring down your ideals to
a more practical level, you ought not to marry. If you do, the result
will be misery for both of you. In a few months you will lose all
regard for a commonplace, good, nice, young man, and then life will
become insipid. As to sister Isabelle, she has the same temperament as
you; only this kindergarten has taught her a good lesson of patience
and forbearance. Perhaps she will make a good wife. </p>
<p>There are two sorts of persons in the world. The one &#8212;
strong-nerved, quiet, yielding to nature, not given to much
imagination, yet good, kind, sweet, etc. For such is this world; they
alone are born to be happy. There are others again with high-strung
nerves, tremendously imaginative, with intense feeling, always going
high one moment and coming down the next. For them there is no
happiness. The first class will have almost an even tenor of happiness;
the last will have to run between ecstasy and misery. But of these
alone what we call geniuses are made. There is some truth in the recent
theory that ""genius is a sort madness"". </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 391'-->
<p>Now, persons of this class if they want to be great, they must
fight to finish &#8212; clear out the deck for battle. No encumbrance &#8212; no
marriage, no children, no undue attachment to anything except the one <i>idea</i>,
and live and die for that. I am a person of this sort. I have taken up
the one idea of ""Vedanta"" and I have ""cleared the deck for action"". You
and Isabelle are made of this metal; but let me tell you, though it is
hard, <i>you are spoiling your lives in vain</i>. Either
take up one <i>idea</i>, clear the deck, and to it
dedicate the life; or be contented and practical; lower the ideal,
marry, and have a <i>happy life</i>. Either ""Bhoga"" or
""Yoga"" &#8212; either enjoy this life, or give up and be a Yogi; <i>none
can have both in one</i>. Now or never, select quick. ""He who is
very particular gets nothing"", says the proverb. Now sincerely and
really and for ever determine to ""clear the deck for fight"", take up
anything, philosophy or science or religion or literature, and let that
be your God for the rest of your life. Achieve happiness or achieve
greatness. I have no sympathy with you and Isabelle; you are neither
for this nor for that. I wish to see you happy, as Harriet has well
chosen, or <i>great</i>. Eating, drinking, dressing, and
society nonsense are not things to throw a life upon &#8212; especially you,
Mary. You are rusting away a splendid brain and abilities, for which
there is not the least excuse. You must have ambition to be great. I
know you will take these rather harsh remarks from me in the right
spirit knowing I like you really as much or more than what I call you,
my sisters. I had long had a mind to tell you this, and as experience
is gathering I feel like telling you. The joyful news from Harriet
urged me to tell you this. I will be overjoyed to hear that you are
married also and happy, so far as happiness can be had here, or would
like to hear of you as doing great deeds. </p>
<p>I had a pleasant visit with Prof. Deussen in Germany. I am
sure you have heard of him as the greatest living<!--'Volume 8 Page 392'-->
German philosopher. He and I travelled together to England and today
came together to see my friend here with whom I am to stop for the rest
of my stay in England. He (Deussen) is very fond of talking Sanskrit
and is the only Sanskrit scholar in the West who can talk in it. As he
wants to get a practice, he never talks to me in any other language but
Sanskrit. </p>
<p>I have come over here amongst my friends, shall work for a few
weeks, and then go back to India in the winter.&nbsp; </p>

If it goes on this way, I would have soon to lose all personal identity even in the flesh — at least to all the rest of the world.

It is impossible to express my joy in words at the good news contained in Harriet's letter. I have written to her today. I am sorry I cannot come over to see her married, but I will be present in ""fine body"" with all good wishes and blessings. Well, I am expecting such news from you and other sisters to make my joy complete. Now, my dear Mary, I will tell you a great lesson I have learnt in this life. It is this: ""The higher is your ideal, the more miserable you are""; for such a thing as an idealcannotbe attainedin the world, or in this life even. He who wants perfection in the world is a madman, for it cannot be.

How can you find the Infinite in the finite? Therefore I tell you, Harriet will have a most blessed and happy life, because she is not so imaginative and sentimental as to make a fool of herself. She has enough of sentiment as to make life sweet, and enough of common sense and gentleness as to soften the hard points inlife which must come to everyone. So has Harriet McKindley in a still higher degree. She is just the girl to make the best of wives, only this world is so full of idiots that very few can penetrate beyond the flesh! As for you and Isabelle, I will tell you the truth, and my ""language is plain"".

You, Mary, are like a mettlesome Arab — grand, splendid. You will make a splendid queen — physically, mentally. You will shine alongside of a dashing, bold, adventurous, heroic husband; but, my dear sister, you will make one of the worst of wives. You will take the life out of our easy-going, practical, plodding husbands of the everyday world. Mind, my sister, although it is true that there is more romance in actual life than in any novel, yet it is few and far between. Therefore my advice to you is that until you bring down your ideals to a more practical level, you ought not to marry. If you do, the result will be misery for both of you. In a few months you will lose all regard for a commonplace, good, nice, young man, and then life will become insipid. As to sister Isabelle, she has the same temperament as you; only this kindergarten has taught her a good lesson of patience and forbearance. Perhaps she will make a good wife.

There are two sorts of persons in the world. The one — strong-nerved, quiet, yielding to nature, not given to much imagination, yet good, kind, sweet, etc. For such is this world; they alone are born to be happy. There are others again with high-strung nerves, tremendously imaginative, with intense feeling, always going high one moment and coming down the next. For them there is no happiness. The first class will have almost an even tenor of happiness; the last will have to run between ecstasy and misery. But of these alone what we call geniuses are made. There is some truth in the recent theory that ""genius is a sort madness"".

Now, persons of this class if they want to be great, they must fight to finish — clear out the deck for battle. No encumbrance — no marriage, no children, no undue attachment to anything except the oneidea, and live and die for that. I am a person of this sort. I have taken up the one idea of ""Vedanta"" and I have ""cleared the deck for action"". You and Isabelle are made of this metal; but let me tell you, though it is hard,you are spoiling your lives in vain. Either take up oneidea, clear the deck, and to it dedicate the life; or be contented and practical; lower the ideal, marry, and have ahappy life. Either ""Bhoga"" or ""Yoga"" — either enjoy this life, or give up and be a Yogi;none can have both in one. Now or never, select quick. ""He who is very particular gets nothing"", says the proverb. Now sincerely and really and for ever determine to ""clear the deck for fight"", take up anything, philosophy or science or religion or literature, and let that be your God for the rest of your life. Achieve happiness or achieve greatness. I have no sympathy with you and Isabelle; you are neither for this nor for that. I wish to see you happy, as Harriet has well chosen, orgreat. Eating, drinking, dressing, and society nonsense are not things to throw a life upon — especially you, Mary. You are rusting away a splendid brain and abilities, for which there is not the least excuse. You must have ambition to be great. I know you will take these rather harsh remarks from me in the right spirit knowing I like you really as much or more than what I call you, my sisters. I had long had a mind to tell you this, and as experience is gathering I feel like telling you. The joyful news from Harriet urged me to tell you this. I will be overjoyed to hear that you are married also and happy, so far as happiness can be had here, or would like to hear of you as doing great deeds.

I had a pleasant visit with Prof. Deussen in Germany. I am sure you have heard of him as the greatest livingGerman philosopher. He and I travelled together to England and today came together to see my friend here with whom I am to stop for the rest of my stay in England. He (Deussen) is very fond of talking Sanskrit and is the only Sanskrit scholar in the West who can talk in it. As he wants to get a practice, he never talks to me in any other language but Sanskrit.

I have come over here amongst my friends, shall work for a few weeks, and then go back to India in the winter.","Ever your loving brother,

<p>DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>All of you have doubtless reached Madras by this time. I
should think Biligiri is certainly taking great care of you, and that
Sadananda serves you as your attendant. In Madras the worship should be
done in a completely Sattvic manner, without a trace of Rajas in it. I
hope Alasinga has by now returned to Madras. Don't enter into wrangles
with anybody &#8212; always maintain a calm attitude. For the present let the
worship of Shri Ramakrishna be established and continued in the house
of Biligiri. But see that the worship does not become very elaborate
and long. Time thus saved should be utilised in holding classes and
doing some preaching. It is good to initiate as many as you can.
Supervise the work of the two papers, and help in whatever way you can.
Biligiri has two widowed daughters. Kindly educate them and make
special efforts that through them more such widowed women get a
thorough grounding in their own religion and learn a little English and
Sanskrit. But all this work should be done from a distance. One has to
be exceedingly careful before young women. Once you fall, there is no
way out, and the sin is unpardonable. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 398'-->
<p>I am very sorry to hear that Gupta was bitten by a dog; but I
hear that the dog was not a mad one, so there is no cause for alarm. In
any case, see that he takes the medicine sent by Gangadhar. </p>
<p>Early morning, finish daily your worship and other duties
briefly, and calling together Biligiri with his family, read before
them the Gita and other sacred books. There is not the least necessity
for teaching the divine Love of Râdhâ and Krishna. Teach them pure
devotion to Sitâ-Râm and Hara-Pârvati. See that no mistake is made in
this respect. Remember that the episodes of the divine relationship
between Radha and Krishna are quite unsuitable for young minds.
Specially Biligiri and other followers of Râmânujâchârya are
worshippers of Rama; so see to it that their innate attitude of pure
devotion is never disturbed. </p>
<p>In the evenings give some spiritual teaching like that to the
general public. Thus gradually ""even the mountain is crossed"". </p>
<p>See that an atmosphere of perfect purity is always maintained,
and that there enters not the slightest trace of Vâmâchâra. For the
rest, the Lord Himself will guide you, there is no fear. Give to
Biligiri my respectful salutations and loving greetings, and convey my
salutations to similar devotees. </p>
<p>My illness is now much less &#8212; it may even be cured completely,
if the Lord wills. My love, blessings, and greetings to you. </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours affectionately, <br>
VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p>PS. Please tender my specially affectionate greetings and
blessings to Dr. Nanjunda Rao and help him as much as you can. Try your
best to particularly encourage the study of Sanskrit among the
non-Brahmins. </p>

<p>There are moments when one feels entirely despondent, no doubt
&#8212; especially when one has worked towards an ideal during a whole life's

would you believe it, without taking any medicine, only by the exercise
of mental healing! I am going again to another hill station tomorrow,
as it is very hot in the plains. Your society is still living, I am
sure. I will send you a report, as least every month, of the work done
here. The London work is not doing well at all, I hear,<!--'Volume 8 Page 400'-->

<p>From your letter I got all the important news. I got<!--'Volume 8 Page 401'-->

the hot plains within two or three months. After that I shall make a
tour and shall certainly secure some money. This being so, if you think
that the [land with a] frontage of eight Kâthâs cannot be acquired . .

use your own discretion; I cannot give any further advice. There is

Master Mahashay that I quite approve of what he had said. </p>
<p>Write to Gangadhar that if he finds it difficult to get alms

that he should publish a weekly letter in Upen's paper (<i>The
Basumati</i>). In that case others also may help. </p>
<p>I understand from a letter of Shashi . . . he wants
Nirbhayananda. If you think this course to be the best, then send
Nirbhayananda and bring back Gupta. . . . Send Sashi a copy of the
Bengali Rules and Regulations of the Math or an English version of it,
and write to him to see that the work there is done in accordance with
the Rules and Regulations. </p>

Almora &#8212; a garden abutting several miles of mountains and forests.
Night before last a leopard came here and took away a goat from the
flock kept in this garden. It was a frightful din the servants made and
the barking of the big Tibet watchdogs. These dogs are kept chained at
a distance all night since I am here, so that they may not disturb my
sleep with their deep barks. The leopard thus found his opportunity and
got a decent meal, perhaps, after weeks. May it do much good to him! </p>
<p>Do you remember Miss Müller? She has come here for a few days
and was rather frightened when she heard of the leopard incident. The
demand for tanned skins in London seems very great, and that is playing
havoc with our leopards and tigers more than anything else. </p>

good. </p>

you like to have a good rest, say for some years, and no work? Sleep,
eat, and exercise; exercise, eat, and sleep &#8212; that is what I am going
to do some months yet. Mr. Goodwin is with me. You ought to have seen
him in his Indian clothes. I am very soon going to shave his head and

DEAR MARIE,

I begin here my promised big chatty letter with the best intention as to its growth, and if it fails, it will beowing to your own Karma. I am sure you are enjoying splendid health. I have been very, very bad indeed; now recovering a bit — hope to recover very soon.

What about the work in London? I am afraid it is going to pieces. Do you now and then visit London? Hasn't Sturdy got a new baby?

The plains of India are blazing now. I cannot bear it. So I am here in this hill station — a bit cooler than the plains.

I am living in a beautiful garden belonging to a merchant of Almora — a garden abutting several miles of mountains and forests. Night before last a leopard came here and took away a goat from the flock kept in this garden. It was a frightful din the servants made and the barking of the big Tibet watchdogs. These dogs are kept chained at a distance all night since I am here, so that they may not disturb my sleep with their deep barks. The leopard thus found his opportunity and got a decent meal, perhaps, after weeks. May it do much good to him!

Do you remember Miss Müller? She has come here for a few days and was rather frightened when she heard of the leopard incident. The demand for tanned skins in London seems very great, and that is playing havoc with our leopards and tigers more than anything else.

As I am writing to you, before me, reflecting the afternoon's flow, stand long, long lines of huge snow peaks. They are about twenty miles as the crow flies from here, and forty through the circuitous mountain roads.

I hope your translations have been well received in the Countess's paper. I had a great mind and very good opportunity of coming over to England this Jubilee season with some of our Princes, but my physicians would not allow me to venture into work so soon. For going to Europe means work, isn't it? No work, no bread.

Here the yellow cloth is sufficient, and I would havefood enough. Anyhow I am taking a much desired rest, hope it will do me good.

How are you going on with your work? With joy or sorrow? Don't you like to have a good rest, say for some years, and no work? Sleep, eat, and exercise; exercise, eat, and sleep — that is what I am going to do some months yet. Mr. Goodwin is with me. You ought to have seen him in his Indian clothes. I am very soon going to shave his head and make a full-blown monk of him.

Are you still practising some of the Yogas? Do you find any benefit from them? I learn that Mr. Martin is dead. How is Mrs. Martin — do you see her now and then?

Do you know Miss Noble? Do you ever see her? Here my letter comes to an end, as a huge dust storm is blowing over me, and it is impossible to write. It is all your Karma, dear Marie, for I intended to write so many wonderful things and tell you such fine stories; but I will have to keep them for the future, and you will have to wait.","Ever yours in the Lord,VIVEKANANDA.",,567,5,0

<p>MY DEAR MISS NOBLE, </p>
<p>. . . Let me tell you plainly. Every word you write I value,
and every letter is welcome a hundred times.<!--'Volume 8 Page 406'-->
Write whenever you have a mind and opportunity, and whatever you like,
knowing that nothing will be misinterpreted, nothing unappreciated. I
have not had any news of the work for so long. Can you tell me
anything? I do not expect any help from India, in spite of all the
jubilating over me. They are so poor! </p>
<p>But I have started work in the fashion in which I myself was
trained &#8212; that is to say, under the trees, and keeping body and soul
together anyhow. The plan has also changed a little. I have sent some
of my boys to work in the famine districts. It has acted like a
miracle. I find, as I always thought, that it is through the heart, and
that alone, that the world can be reached. The present plan is,
therefore, to train up numbers of young men (from the highest classes,
not the lowest. For the latter I shall have to wait a little), and the
first attack will be made by sending a number of them over a district.
When these sappers and miners of religion have cleared the way, there
will then be time enough to put in theory and philosophy. </p>
<p>A number of boys are already in training, but the recent
earthquake has destroyed the poor shelter we had to work in, which was
only rented, anyway. Never mind. The work must be done without shelter
and under difficulties. . . . As yet it is shaven heads, rags, and
casual meals. This must change, however, and will, for are we not
working for it, head and heart? . . . </p>
<p>It is true in one way that the people here have so little to
give up &#8212; yet renunciation is in our blood. One of my boys in training
has been an executive engineer, in charge of a district. That means a
very big position here. He gave it up like straw! . . . </p>

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>Going to Almora from here I made special efforts for Yogen.
But he left for the plains as soon as he had recovered a little. From
Subhala valley he will write to me of his safe arrival there. As it is
impossible to procure a Dandi (a carrying chair) or any other
conveyance, Latu could not go. Achyut and myself have again come back
to this place. Today my health is a little bad owing to this riding on
horseback at breakneck speed in the sun. I took Shashi Babu's medicine
for two weeks &#8212; I find no special benefit. . . . The pain in the liver
is gone, and owing to plenty of exercise my hands and legs have become
muscular, but the abdomen is distending very much. I feel suffocated
while getting up or sitting down. Perhaps this is due to the taking of
milk. Ask Shashi if I can give up milk. Previously I suffered from two
attacks of sunstroke. From that time, my eyes become red if I expose
myself to the sun, and the health continues to be bad for two or three
days at a stretch. </p>
<p>I was very pleased to get all the news from the Math, and I
also heard that the famine relief work is<!--'Volume 8 Page 411'-->
going on well. Please let me know if any money has been received from
the office of the <i>Brahmavadin</i> for famine relief.
Some money will be sent soon from here also. There is famine in many
other places as well, so it is not necessary to stay so long in one
place. Tell them to move to other localities and write to each man to
go to a separate place. All such work is real work. If the field is
made ready in this way, the seeds of spiritual knowledge can be sown.
Remember this always &#8212; that the only answer to those conservative
fanatics who abuse us is such work. I have no objection to getting the
thing printed as Shashi and Sarada have suggested. </p>
<p>You yourselves come to a decision as to what the name of the
Math should be. . . . The money will come within seven weeks; but I
have no further news about the land. In this matter it seems to me that
it will be good if we can get the garden of Kristo Gopal in Cossipore.
(Where Shri Ramakrishna passed his last days.) What do you say? In
future great works will be accomplished. If you agree with me, don't
let this matter out to anybody either within the Math or outside, but
quietly make inquiries. The work is spoiled if plans are not kept
secret. If it can be bought with fifteen or sixteen thousand, then buy
at once &#8212; of course, only if you think it good. If something more is
demanded, make some advance payment and wait for those seven weeks. My
view is that for the present it is better to buy it. Everything else
will come by and by. All our associations centre round that garden. In
reality that is our first Math. Let the thing be done very privately. </p>
<p>A work can be judged by its results only, just as one can
infer the nature of previous mental tendencies by their resultant in
present behaviour. . . . </p>
<p>Undoubtedly the price of the land of the garden at Cossipore
has increased; but our purse has, on the other hand, dwindled. Do
something or other, but do it quickly.<!--'Volume 8 Page 412'-->
All work is spoilt by dilatoriness. This garden also has to be acquired
&#8212; if not today, tomorrow &#8212; however big the Math on the banks of the
Ganga may be. It will be still better if you can broach the subject
through a proxy. If they hear that we are willing to buy, they will bid

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

Going to Almora from here I made special efforts for Yogen. But he left for the plains as soon as he had recovered a little. From Subhala valley he will write to me of his safe arrival there.

Perhaps this is due to the taking of milk. Ask Shashi if I can give up milk. Previously I suffered from two attacks of sunstroke. From that time, my eyes become red if I expose myself to the sun, and the health continues to be bad for two or three days at a stretch.

You yourselves come to a decision as to what the name of the Math should be. . . . The money will come within seven weeks; but I have no further news about the land.

<i>25th July, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARIE, </p>
<p>I have time, will, and opportunity now to clear my promise. So
my letter begins. I have been very weak for some time, and with that
and other things my visit to England this Jubilee season had to be
postponed. </p>
<p>I was very sorry at first not to be able to meet my nice<!--'Volume 8 Page 413'-->
and very dear friends once more, but Karma cannot be avoided, and I had
to rest contented with my Himalayas. It is a sorry exchange, after all;
for the beauty of the living spirit shining through the human face is
far more pleasurable than any amount of material beauty. </p>
<p>Is not the soul the Light of the world? </p>
<p>The work in London had to go slow &#8212; for various reasons, and
last though not the least was <i>l'argent, mon amie</i>!
When I am there <i>l'argent</i> comes in somehow, to keep
the mare going. Now everybody shrugs his shoulder. I must come again
and try my best to revive the work. </p>
<p>I am having a good deal of riding and exercise, but I had to
drink a lot of skimmed milk per prescription of the doctors, with the
result that I am more to the front than back! I am always a forward man
though &#8212; but do not want to be too prominent just now, and I have given
up drinking milk. </p>
<p>I am glad to learn that you are eating your meals with good
appetite. </p>
<p>Do you know Miss Margaret Noble of Wimbledon? She is working
hard for me. Do correspond with her if you can, and you help me a good
deal there. Her address is, Brantwood, Worple Road, Wimbledon. </p>
<p>So you saw my little friend Miss Orchard and you liked her too
&#8212; good. I have great hopes for her. And how I should like to be retired
from life's activities entirely when I am very old, and hear the world
ringing with the names of my dear, dear young friends like yourself and
Miss Orchard etc.! </p>
<p>By and by, I am glad to find that I am aging fast, my hair is
turning grey. ""Silver threads among the gold"" &#8212; I mean black &#8212; are
coming in fast. </p>
<p>It is bad for a preacher to be young, don't you think so? I
do, as I did all my life. People have more confidence in an old man,
and it looks more venerable. Yet the old rogues are the worst rogues in
the world, isn't it? </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 414'-->
<p>The world has its code of judgment which, alas, is very
different from that of truth's. </p>
<p>So your ""Universal Religion"" has been rejected by the <i>Revue
de deux Mondes</i>. Never mind, try again some other paper. Once
the ice is broken, you get in at a quick rate, I am sure. And I am so
glad that you love the work: it will make its way, I have no doubt of
it. Our ideas have a future, <i>ma chere</i> Marie &#8212; and
it will be realised soon. </p>
<p>I think this letter will meet you in Paris &#8212; your beautiful
Paris &#8212; and I hope you will write me lots about French journalism and
the coming ""World's Fair"" there. </p>
<p>I am so glad that you have been helped by Vedanta and Yoga. I
am unfortunately sometimes like the circus clown who makes others
laugh, himself miserable! </p>
<p>You are naturally of a buoyant temperament. Nothing seems to
touch you. And you are moreover a very prudent girl, inasmuch as you
have scrupulously kept yourself away from ""love"" and all its nonsense.
So you see you have made your good Karma and planted the seed of your
lifelong well-being. Our difficulty in life is that we are guided by
the present and not by the future. What gives us a little pleasure now
drags us on to follow it, with the result that we always buy a mass of
pain in the future for a little pleasure in the present. </p>
<p>I wish I had nobody to love, and I were an orphan in my
childhood. The greatest misery in my life has been my own people &#8212; my
brothers and sisters and mother etc. Relatives are like deadly clogs to
one's progress, and is it not a wonder that people will still go on to
find new ones by <i>marriage</i>!!! </p>
<p>He who is alone is happy. Do good to all, like everyone, but <i>do
not love</i> anyone. It is a bondage, and bondage brings only
misery. Live alone in your mind &#8212; that is happiness. To have nobody to
care for and never minding who cares for one is the way to be free. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 415'-->
<p>I envy so much your frame of mind &#8212; quiet, gentle, light, yet
deep and <i>free</i>. You are already free, Marie, free
already &#8212; you are Jivanmukta. I am more of a woman than a man, you are
more of a man than woman. I am always dragging other's pain into me &#8212;
for nothing, without being able to do any good to anybody &#8212; just as
women, if they have no children, bestow all their love upon a cat!!! </p>
<p>Do you think this has any spirituality in it? Nonsense, it is
all material <i>nervous bondage</i> &#8212; that is what it is.
O! to get rid of the thraldom of the flesh! </p>
<p>Your friend Mrs. Martin very kindly sends me copies of her
magazine every month &#8212; but Sturdy's thermometer is now below zero, it
seems. He seems to be greatly disappointed with my non-arrival in
England this summer. What could I do? </p>
<p>We have started two Maths (monasteries) here, one in Calcutta,
the other in Madras. The Calcutta Math (a wretched rented house) was
awfully shaken in the late earthquake. </p>
<p>We have got in a number of boys, and they are in training;
also we have opened famine relief in several places and the work is
going on apace. We will try to start similar centres in different
places in India. </p>
<p>In a few days I am going down to the plains and from thence go
to the Western parts of the mountains. When it is cooler in the plains,
I will make a lecture tour all over and see what work can be done. </p>
<p>Here I cannot find any more time to write &#8212; so many people are

<p>DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>I am very much pained to hear that the work in Madras is not
prospering for want of funds. I am glad to learn that the amount
borrowed by Alasinga's brother-in-law (sister's husband) has been
received back in Almora. Goodwin has written to me to inform the
Reception Committee to take some money for expenses from the amount
that is left as a result of the lecture. It is a very mean thing to
spend the money received on the occasion of that lecture for the
purpose of the Reception &#8212; and I do not like to tell anybody anything
about this matter. I have understood quite well what the people of our
country are when it comes to money-matters. . . . On my behalf, you
personally talk with the friends there and politely make them
understand that it is all right if they can find ways and means to bear
the expenses; but if they cannot do so, all of you come back to the
Math at Calcutta or go to Ramnad and establish the Math there. </p>
<p>I am now going to the hills at Dharamsala. Niranjan, Dinu,
Krishnalal, Latu, and Achyut will stay at Amritsar. Why did you not,
all these days, send Sadananda to the<!--'Volume 8 Page 418'-->
Math? If he is still there, then send him to the Punjab on receipt of a
letter from Niranjan from Amritsar. I intend to start work in the
Punjab after a few days' more rest in the Punjab hills. The Punjab and
Rajputana are indeed fields for work. I shall write to you again soon
after starting work. . . . </p>
<p>My health was very bad recently. Now I am very slowly
recovering. It will be all right, if I stay in the hills for some more
days. My love to you and to Alasinga, G. G., R. A., Goodwin, Gupta,

Rs. 20,000. Even if we buy that house, there are still a lot of
difficulties; for example, we shall have to break it down in part and

repairs. Moreover the house is very old and ramshackle. However,
consult Girish Babu and Atul and do what you decide to be best. Today I

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>Now Kashmir. The excellent accounts you heard of this place
are all true. There is no place so beautiful as this; and the people
also are fair and good-looking, though their eyes are not beautiful.
But I have also never seen elsewhere villages and towns so horribly
dirty. In Srinagar I am now putting up at the house of Rishibar Babu.
He is very hospitable and kind. Send all my letters to his address. In
a few days I shall go out somewhere else on excursions; but while
returning, I shall come by way of Srinagar, and so shall get the
letters also. I have read the letter that you sent regarding Gangadhar.
Write to him that there are many orphans in Central India and in
Gorakhpur. From there the Punjabis are getting many children. You must
persuade<!--'Volume 8 Page 420'--> Mahendra Babu and get
up an agitation about this matter, so that the people of Calcutta are
induced to take up the charge of these orphans &#8212; such a movement is
very desirable. Especially a memorial should be sent to the Government
requesting it to see that orphans taken over by the missionaries are
returned to the Hindus. Tell Gangadhar to come over; and on behalf of
the Ramakrishna Society a tearing campaign should be made. Gird up your
loins, and go to every house to carry on the campaign. Hold mass
meetings etc. Whether you succeed or not, start a furious agitation.
Get all the facts from the important Bengali friends at Gorakhpur by
writing to them, and let there be a countrywide agitation over this.
Let the Ramakrishna Society be fully established. The secret of the
whole thing is to agitate and agitate without respite. I am much
pleased to see the orderliness of Sarada's work. Gangadhar and Sarada
should not rest satisfied until they have succeeded in creating a
centre in every place they visit. </p>
<p>Just now I received a letter from Gangadhar. It is good news
that he is determined to start a centre in that district. Write to him
saying that his friend, the Magistrate, has sent an excellent reply to
my letter. As soon as we come down to the plains from Kashmir, I shall
send back Latu, Niranjan, Dinu, and Khoka. For there is no suitable
work for them here any more; also within three to four weeks send
Shuddhananda, Sushil, and one other to me. Send them to the house of
Mr. Shyamacharan Mukhopadhyaya, Medical Hall, Cantonment, Ambala. From
there I shall go to Lahore. They should have each two thick
gerua-coloured jerseys, and two blankets for bedding. I shall buy them
woollen <i>chaddars</i>, and other woollen necessities in
Lahore. If the translation of <i>Râja-Yoga</i> has been
completed, get it published bearing all the cost. . . . Where the
language is obscure, make it very simple and clear, and let Tulsi make
a<!--'Volume 8 Page 421'--> Hindi translation of it if he
can. If these books are published, they will help the Math very
greatly. </p>
<p>I hope your health is now quite all right. Since reaching
Dharamsala I have been all right. I like the cold places; there the
body keeps well. I have a desire either to visit a few places in
Kashmir and then choose an excellent site and live a quiet life there,
or to go on floating on the water. I shall do what the doctor advises.
The Raja is not here now. His brother, the one just next to him in age,
is the Commander-in-Chief. Efforts are being made to arrange a lecture
under his chairmanship. I shall write all about this afterwards. If the
meeting for the lecture is held in a day or two, I shall stay back,
otherwise I go out again on my travels. Sevier is still at Murree. His
health is very bad &#8212; going about in the jolting <i>tongas</i>
and <i>jutkas</i>. The Bengali gentlemen of Murree are
very good and courteous. Give my respects to G. C. Ghosh, Atul, Master
Mahashay, and others, and keep up the spirits of everybody. What is the
news about the house which Yogen suggested we should buy? In October I
shall go down from here and shall deliver a few lectures in the Punjab.
After that I may go via Sind to Cutch, Bhuj, and Kathiawar &#8212; even down
to Poona if circumstances are favourable; otherwise I go to Rajputana
via Baroda. From Rajputana I go to the North-Western Province, (In
those days this was made up of Uttar Pradesh and part of the Punjab.)
then Nepal, and finally Calcutta &#8212; this is my present programme.
Everything, however, is in God's hands. My love and greetings to all. </p>

<p>We are in Kashmir at last. I need not tell you of all the
beauties of the place. It is the one land fit for Yogis, to my mind.
But the land is now inhabited by a race who though possessing great
physical beauty are extremely dirty. I am going to travel by water for
a month seeing the sights and getting strong. But the city is very
malarious just now, and Sadananda and Kristolal have got fever.
Sadananda is all right today, but Kristolal has fever yet. The doctor
came today and gave him a purgative. He will be all right by tomorrow,
we hope; and we start also tomorrow. The State has lent me one of its
barges, and it is fine and quite comfortable. They have also sent
orders to the Tahsildars of different districts. The people here are
crowding in banks to see us and are doing everything they can to make
us comfortable. </p>
<p>A clipping from <i>The Indian Mirror</i>, quoting
passages from an article written by Dr. Barrows in an American paper,
has been sent over to me by somebody without a name and asking me what
reply to give. I send back the cutting to Brahmananda with my answer to
the passages which are damned lies! </p>
<p>I am glad to learn you are doing well there and going on with
your usual work. I also had a letter from Shivananda giving the details

<p>After a month I go back to the Punjab, and I will<!--'Volume 8 Page 423'-->

I have travelled far and wide, but I have never seen such a country. I shall soon leave for the Punjab and again go to work. From Sadananda I have heard all the news about you and continue to get it. I am sure to go to Karachi after visiting the Punjab. So we shall meet in person there.","With blessings,

<p>DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I received your affectionate letter and also the letter from
the Math. I am leaving for the Punjab in two or three days. I have
received the foreign mail. The following are my answers to Miss Noble's
questions in her letter: </p>
<p>1. Nearly all the branches have been started, but the movement
is only just beginning. </p>
<p>2. Most of the monks are educated. Those that are not are also
having secular education. But above all, to do good, perfect
unselfishness is absolutely necessary.<!--'Volume 8 Page 425'-->
To ensure that, more attention is given to spiritual exercises than to
anything else. </p>
<p>3. Secular educators: We get mostly those who have already
educated themselves. What is needed is training them into our method
and building up of character. The training is to make them obedient and
fearless; and the method is to help the poor physically first and then
work up to higher regions of mentality. </p>
<p>Arts and Industries: This part of the programme alone cannot
be begun for want of funds. The simplest method to be worked upon at
present is to induce Indians to use their own produce and get markets
for Indian artware etc. in other countries. This should be done by
persons who are not only not middlemen themselves, but will devote the
entire proceeds of this branch to the benefit of the workmen. </p>
<p>4. Wandering from place to place will be necessary till
""people come to education"". The religious character of the wandering
monks will carry with it a much greater weight than otherwise. </p>
<p>5. All castes are open to our influence. So long the highest
only have been worked upon. But since the work department is in full
operation in different famine-centres, we are influencing the lower
classes more and more. </p>
<p>6. Nearly all the Hindus approve our work, only they are not

<p>Some people do the best work when <i>led</i>. Not

<p>I shall not try to describe Kashmir to you. Suffice it to say,
I never felt sorry to leave any country except this Paradise on earth;
and I am trying my best, if I can, to influence the Raja in starting a

<p>The great difficulty is this: I see persons giving me almost
the whole of their love. But I must not give anyone the whole of mine
in return, for that day the work would be ruined. Yet there are some
who will look for such a return, not having the breadth of the
impersonal view. It is absolutely necessary to the work that I should
have the enthusiastic love of as many as possible, while I myself
remain entirely impersonal. Otherwise jealousy and quarrels would break
up everything. A leader must be impersonal. I am sure you understand
this. I do not mean that one should be a brute, making use of the
devotion of others for his own ends, and laughing in his sleeve
meanwhile. What I mean is what I am, intensely personal in my love, but
having the power to pluck out my own heart with my own hand, if it
becomes necessary, ""for the good of many, for the welfare of many"", as
Buddha said. Madness of love, and yet in it no bondage. Matter changed
into spirit by the force of love. Nay, that is the gist of our Vedanta.
There is but One, seen by the ignorant as matter, by the wise as God.
And the history of civilisation is the progressive reading of spirit
into matter. The ignorant see the person in the non-person. The sage
sees the non-person in the person. Through pain and pleasure, joy and

<i>11th October, 1897</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I feel I have been working as if under an irresistible impulse
for the last ten days, beginning from Kashmir. It may be either a
physical or a mental disease. Now I have come to the conclusion that I
am unfit for further work. . . . I now understand that I have been very
harsh to all of you. But I knew, however, that you would bear with all
my shortcomings; in the Math there is no one else who will do so. I
have been increasingly harsh to you. Whatever has happened is now past
&#8212; it is all the result of past Karma. What is the good of my
repentance? I do not believe in it. It is all Karma. Whatever of
Mother's work was to be accomplished through me, She made me do, and
has now flung me aside breaking down my body and mind. Her will be
done! </p>
<p>Now I retire from all this work. In a day or two I shall give
up everything and wander out alone; I shall spend the rest of my life
quietly in some place or other. Forgive me if you all will, or do what
you like. </p>
<p>Mrs. Bull has given much of the money. She has implicit
confidence in Sharat. Do the work of the Math with Sharat's advice; or
do as you will. </p>
<p>But I have all along been like a hero &#8212; I want my work to be
quick like lightning, and firm as adamant. Likewise shall I die also.
Therefore kindly do my work for me &#8212; no question of success or defeat
enters here at all. I have never retreated in a fight &#8212; shall I now . .
. ? There is success and failure in every work. But I am inclined to
believe that one who is a coward will be born after death as an insect
or a worm, that there is no salvation for a coward<!--'Volume 8 Page 431'-->
even after millions of years of penance. Well, shall I after all be
born as a worm? . . . In my eyes this world is mere play &#8212; and it will
always remain as such. Should one spend six long months brooding over
the questions of honour and disgrace, gain and loss pertaining to this?
. . . I am a man of action. Simply advice upon advice is being given &#8212;
this one says this, that one says that; again that man threatens, and
this one frightens! This life is not, in my view, such a sweet thing
that I would long to live through so much care and caution and fear.
Money, life, friends, and relatives, and the love of men and myself &#8212;
if one wants to enter into work fully assured beforehand of all these &#8212;
if one has to be so much ridden with fear, then one will get just what
Gurudeva used to say, ""The crow thinks itself very clever but . . .""
(The crow thinks itself very clever, but it cannot help eating filth.)
&#8212; well, he will get that. After all, what is the purpose behind all
these &#8212; money and wealth, Maths and institutions, preaching and
lecturing? There is only one purpose in the whole of life &#8212; education.
Otherwise what is the use of men and women, land and wealth? </p>
<p>So loss of money, or loss of anything else &#8212; I cannot bother
about, and I will not. When I fight, I fight with girded loins &#8212; that
much I fully understand; and I also understand that man, that hero,
that god, who says, ""Don't care, be fearless. O brave one, here I am by
your side!"" To such a man-god I offer a million salutations. Their
presence purifies the world, they are the saviours of the world. And
the others who always wail, ""Oh, don't go forward, there is <i>this</i>
danger, there is <i>that</i> danger"" &#8212; those dyspeptics &#8212;
they always tremble with fear. But through the grace of the Divine
Mother my mind is so strong that even the most terrible dyspepsia shall
not make me a coward. To cowards<!--'Volume 8 Page 432'-->
what advice shall I offer? &#8212; nothing whatsoever have I to say. But this
I desire, that I should find shelter at the feet of those brave souls
who dared to do great deeds even though they failed to succeed, of
those heroes who never quailed nor shirked, of those fighters who never
disobeyed orders through fear or pride. I am the child of the Divine
Mother, the source of all power and strength. To me, cringing, fawning,
whining, degrading inertia and hell are one and the same thing. O
Mother of the Universe, O my Gurudeva, who would constantly say, ""This
is a hero!"" &#8212; I pray that I may not have to die a coward. This is my
prayer, O brother. ""&#2313;&#2340;&#2381;&#2346;&#2340;&#2381;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2340;&#2375;&#2365;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367; &#2350;&#2350; &#2325;&#2379;&#2365;&#2346;&#2367; &#2360;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2343;&#2352;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366; &#8212; certainly
there is, or
there will be born one equal to me""; some one or other will certainly
arise from these thousands of devotees of Shri Ramakrishna who will be
like me, and who will be able to understand me. </p>
<p>O hero, awake, and dream no more. Death has caught you by the
forelock . . . still fear not. What I have never done &#8212; fleeing from
the battle &#8212; well, will that happen today? For fear of defeat shall I
retreat from the fight? Defeat is the ornament the hero adorns himself
with. What, to acknowledge defeat without fighting! O Mother, Mother! .
. . Not one capable of even playing second fiddle and yet the mind
filled with petty self-importance, ""We understand everything"". . . .
Now I retire; . . . everything I leave in your control. If Mother sends
me men again in whose heart there is courage, in whose hands strength,
in whose eyes there is fire, real children of the Mother &#8212; if She gives
me even one such, then I shall work again, then I shall return.
Otherwise, I shall take it that, by Mother's will, this is the end. I
am in a tremendous hurry, I want to work at hurricane speed, and I want
fearless hearts. </p>
<p>I have rebuked poor Sarada severely. What to do? . . . I do
scold; but I also have much to complain.<!--'Volume 8 Page 433'-->
. . . Almost suffocated by short breathing, standing and standing, I
have written an article for him. . . . It is all good, otherwise how
will renunciation come? . . . Will Mother in the end kill me with
attachment? I have offended all of you &#8212; do what you want. </p>
<p>I bless you all with a full heart. May Mother enshrine Herself
in your hearts as strength: &#2309;&#2349;&#2351;&#2306; &#2346;&#2381;&#2352;&#2340;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2366;&#2306;&nbsp;&#8212; the support that
is fearlessness &#8212; may She make you all fearless. This I have seen in
life &#8212; he who is over-cautious about himself falls into dangers at
every step; he who is afraid of losing honour and respect, gets only
disgrace; he who is always afraid of loss always loses. . . . May all
good attend you all.</p>

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I hope you and Hari are now in good health. The work in Lahore
went off with great éclat. Now I go to Dehra Dun. The Sind tour is
postponed. I have yet no news whether Dinu, Latu, and Krishnalal have
reached Jaipur. Babu Nagendranath Gupta will collect subscriptions and
donations from here and send them to the Math to meet expenses. Send
him regular receipts. Let me know if you have received anything from
Murree, Rawalpindi, and Sialkot. </p>
<p>Reply to me C/o Post Master, Dehra Dun. Other letters you may
send me after hearing from me from Dehra Dun. My health is good; only I
have to get up at night once or twice. I am having sound sleep; sleep
is not spoiled even after exhausting lectures; and I am doing exercise
every day. . . . There is no trouble at all. Now, come on, work with
redoubled energy. Keep an eye on that big piece of land &#8212; in all
secrecy. We are making regular efforts so that big Utsava (Celebration
&#8212; of Shri Ramakrishna's birthday) can be held there. My love to all. </p>
<p class=""right"">Yours affectionately, <br>
VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p>PS. It will be a very good thing if Master Mahashay will write
now and then about us in <i>The Tribune</i>, so that
Lahore will not become cold again &#8212; now it is quite warmed up. Spend
money a little economically; pilgrimage expenses should be borne by you
personally; preaching and propaganda expenses should be charged to the

<p>Part of the money that Miss Müller promised has reached
Calcutta. The balance will come afterwards in a short while. We have
also some amount. Miss<!--'Volume 8 Page 438'--> Müller
will deposit the money in your name as well as mine with Messrs.
Grindlay &amp; Co. As you have got the power of attorney, you alone
can draw all the money. As soon as the money is deposited, you yourself
with Hari go to Patna and meet that gentleman and by some means or
other influence him; and if the price of the land is reasonable, buy
it. If it cannot be had, try for some other plot of ground. I am trying
to get some money in these parts too. We must hold the big festival on
our own plot of ground &#8212; remember this must be your first and foremost
work, come what may. </p>
<p>You have shown great pluck; the work you have done these last
eight or nine months does you great credit. Now you must see to it that
a Math and a centre in Calcutta are steadily established before
everything else. Work hard to this end but quietly and in secret. Get
information about the Cossipore house also. Tomorrow I am going to
Khetri via Alwar. My health is good, even though I have caught a cold.
Send all letters to Khetri. My love to all. </p>

<p>We shall start for Khetri tomorrow. Gradually the luggage has
greatly increased. After Khetri I intend to<!--'Volume 8 Page 439'-->
send everybody to the Math. I could get done through them none of the
work which I had hoped. That is to say, it is quite certain that none
of them can do anything if he always remains with me. Unless each goes
about independently, he will not be able to do anything. The fact is,
who will care for them if they are in my company? Only waste of time.
So I am sending them to the Math. </p>
<p>Keep as a fund for some permanent work the balance of the
money left after the famine relief. Do not spend that money for any
other purpose, and after giving the full accounts of the famine work,
note down thus, ""So much balance is left for some other good work"". . .
. </p>
<p>Work I want &#8212; I don't want any humbug. To those who have no
desire to work I say, ""My dear fellow, now go and follow your own way.""
As soon as I reach Khetri, I will send you the power of attorney with
my signature if the document has reached there meanwhile. Open only
those letters from America which bear the Boston postmark, not the
others. Send all my letters to Khetri. I shall get money in Rajputana
itself; no cause for anxiety on that score. Try energetically for the
piece of land; we must have the celebration on our own ground this
time. </p>
<p>Is the money in the Bengal Bank, or have you kept it
elsewhere? Be very careful about money matters; keep detailed accounts,
and regarding money know for certain that one cannot rely even on one's
own father. </p>
<p>Give my love to all. Write to me how Hari is doing. Recently I
met at Dehra Dun the Udâsi Sâdhu, Kalyân Dev, and a few others. I hear
the people at Hrishikesh are very eager to see me and are asking again

MY DEAR RAJAJI,

My gratitude for your very kind invitation to speak. I had a talk with Mr. Bhattacharya on the subject a few days back, and I am trying my best as a result to find time for your Society. I also promised to let them know the result on Sunday.

A friend to whom I owe much is here, presumably, to take me to his place in Darjeeling.

There are some American friends come, and every spare moment is occupied in working for the new Math and several organisations therein, and I expect to leave India next month for America.

HOWRAH P.O., <br>
<i>25th February, 1898</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SHASHI, </p>
<p>Our congratulations for the successful carrying out of the
Mahotsava (Big celebration of Shri Ramakrishna's birthday.)&nbsp;
in Madras. Hope you had a good gathering and plenty of spiritual food.
We are all so glad that you have girded yourself to teach more of
spirituality to the Madras people than those finger twistings and <i>kling
phat</i> (Cryptic Mantras or sound formulae.) you are so fond of.
Really your lecture on <i>Shriji</i> (Shri Ramakrishna.)
was splendid. I could only catch a report in the <i>Madras Mail</i>
in Khandwa, and the Math people have not had any. Why don't you send us
over a copy? </p>
<p>I learn that you complain about my silence, is it? I have
written you more letters, however, than you ever<!--'Volume 8 Page 443'-->
wrote me, from Europe and America even. You ought to give me all the
news you can from Madras every week. Simplest way is to put down a few
lines and a few items of news every day on a sheet. </p>
<p>My health has not been all right of late; at present it is
much better. Calcutta is unusually cool just now, and the American
friends who are here are enjoying it ever so much. Today we take
possession of the land we have bought, and though it is not practicable
to have the Mahotsava on it just now, I must have something on it on
Sunday. Anyhow, <i>Shriji's</i> relics must be taken to
our place for the day and worshipped. Gangadhar is here and asks me to
write to you that though he has succeeded in getting some subscriptions
for the<i> Brahmavadin</i>, the delivery being very
irregular, he is afraid of losing them also soon. I received your
letter of recommendation for the young man with the old story of
""having nothing to eat, Your Honour""; only added in the Madras edition:
""got a number of children too"", for generating whom no recommendation
was needed! I would be very glad to help him, but the fact is, I have
no money; every cent I had I have made over to Raja, (Rakhal or Swami
Brahmananda.) as they all say I am a spendthrift and are afraid of
keeping money with me. I have, however, sent the letter to Rakhal if he
can find the way to help your friend, the young man, in having some
more children. He writes that the Christians will help him out if he
becomes a convert, but he won't. Perhaps he is afraid that his
conversion will make Hindu India lose one of her brightest jewels and
Hindu society the benefit of his propagating power to eternal misery! </p>
<p>The boys here are rather seedy owing to the unusual amount of
pure and cool air they are made to breathe in and live on the bank of
the Ganga in the new Math. Sarada has his malaria brought over from
Dinajpur. I<!--'Volume 8 Page 444'--> made him eat a dose
of opium the other day without much benefit to him except his brain
which progressed for some hours towards its natural direction, namely,
idiocy. Hari also has a touch; I hope it will take off a good bit of
their avoirdupois. By the by, we have once more started the dancing
business here, and it would make your heart glad to see Hari and Sarada
and my own good self in a waltz. How we keep balance at all is a wonder
to me. </p>
<p>Sharat has come and is hard at work as usual. We have got some
good furniture now, and a big jump from the old Châtâi (mat) in the old
Math to nice tables and chairs and three Khâts (cots), mind you. We
have curtailed the Pujâ (worship) work a good deal, and the amount of
pruning your <i>klings</i> and <i>phats</i>
and <i>svâhâs</i> have undergone would make you faint. The
puja occupied only the day, and they slept soundly all night. How are
Tulsi and Khoka? Are they more tractable with you than under Rakhal?
You may run in to Calcutta for a few days giving charge to Tulsi, but
it is so expensive, and then you must go back, as Madras has to be <i>thoroughly
worked up</i>. I am going to America again with Mrs. Bull in a
few months. </p>
<p>Give my love to Goodwin and tell him that we are going to see
him at any rate on our way to Japan. Shivananda is here, and I have
toned down a bit his <i>great desire</i> to go to the
Himalayas <i>for food</i>! Is Tulsi contemplating the
same? The <i>bandicoot-hole</i> will be a sufficient cave
for him, I suppose. </p>
<p>So the Math here is a <i>fait accompli</i>, and I
am going over to get more help. . . . Work on with energy. India is a
rotten corpse inside and outside. We shall revive it by the blessings
of Shri Maharaj. With all love,&nbsp; </p>

<i>2nd March, 1898</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>You have news of me already, I hope, through the letter I
wrote to Mother Church. You are all so kind, the whole family, to me, I
must have belonged to you in the past, as we Hindus say. My only regret
is that the millionaires do not materialise: and I want them so badly
just now that I am growing decrepit and old and hot in the midst of
building and organising. Though Harriet has got one of a million
virtues, a few millions of cash virtue would have made it more shining,
I am sure; so you do not commit the same mistake. </p>
<p>A certain young couple had everything favourable to make them
man and wife except that the bride's father was determined not to give
his daughter to anyone who had not a million. The young people were in
despair when a clever matchmaker came to the rescue. He asked the
bridegroom whether he was willing to part with his nose on payment of a
million &#8212; which he refused. The matchmaker then swore before the
bride's father that the bridegroom had in store goods worth several
millions, and the match was completed. Don't you take like millions. </p>
<p>Well, well, you could not get the millionaire, so I could not
get the money; so I had to worry a good deal and work hard to no
purpose; so I got the disease. It requires brains like mine to find out
the true cause &#8212; I am charmed with myself! </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 446'-->
<p>Well, it was in Southern India, when I came from London and
when the people were feting and feasting and pumping all the work out
of me, that an old hereditary disease made its appearance. The tendency
was always there, and excess of mental work made it ""express"" itself.
Total collapse and extreme prostration followed, and I had to leave
Madras immediately for the cooler North; a day's delay meant waiting
for a week in that awful heat for another steamer. By the by, I learnt
afterwards that Mr. Barrows arrived in Madras next day and was very
much chagrined at not finding me as he expected, though I helped
getting up an address for him and arranged for his reception. Poor man,
he little knew I was at death's door then. </p>
<p>I have been travelling in the Himalayas all through last
summer; and a cold climate, I found immediately, brought me round; but
as soon as I come into the heat of the plains I am down again. From
today the heat in Calcutta is becoming intense, and I will soon have to
fly. This time to cool America as Mrs. Bull and Miss MacLeod are here.
I have bought a piece of land for the institution on the river Ganga
near Calcutta, on which is a little house where they are living now;
within a stone's throw is the house where the Math is situated at
present in which we live. </p>
<p>So I see them every day and they are enjoying it immensely <i>à
L'Inde</i>. They intend making a trip to Kashmir in a month, and
I am going with them as a guide and friend and philosopher perhaps, if
they are willing. After that we all sail for the land of freedom and
scandal. </p>
<p>You need not be alarmed with me as the disease will take two
or three years at worst to carry me off. At best it may remain a
harmless companion. I am content. Only I am working hard to set things
all right and always so that the machine moves forward when I am off
the stage. Death I have conquered long ago when I gave<!--'Volume 8 Page 447'-->

a letter almost every mail to Madras while I was out of India. I have
in vain written for a copy of those letters. Send me all those letters.
I want to write out my travels. Do not fail, and I shall send them back
as soon as they have been used up. The <i>Dawn</i> can
manage with 200 subscribers to come out regularly on Rs. 40/- an issue
expenditure. This is a great fact to know. The P.B. (<i>Prabuddha
Bhârata</i>) seems to be very disorganised; try best to organise
it. Poor Alasinga, I am sorry for him. Only thing I can do is to make
him entirely free for a year so that he may devote all his energy to
the <i>Brahmavadin</i> work. Tell him not to worry; I have
him always in mind, poor child; his devotion I can never repay. </p>
<p>I am thinking of going to Kashmir again with Mrs. Bull and
Miss MacLeod. (I) return to Calcutta and start for America from here. </p>
<p>Miss Noble is really an acquisition. She will soon surpass

<p>Do look after Alasinga. I have an idea that he is<!--'Volume 8 Page 448'-->
breaking himself with work. Tell him, the best work is only done by
alternate repose and work. Give him all my love. We had two public
lectures in Calcutta, one from Miss Noble and the other from our
Sharat. Both of them did very well indeed; there was great enthusiasm,
which shows that the Calcutta public has not forgotten us. Some of the
members of the Math had a touch of influenza. They are all right now.
The thing is working nicely. Shri (Holy) Mother is here, and the
European and American ladies went the other day to see her, and what do
you think, <i>Mother ate with them even there</i>! Is not
that grand? The Lord is watching over us; there is no fear; do not lose
your nerves, keep your health and take things easy. It is always good
to give a few strong strokes and rest on your oars. Rakhal is living
with the new land and buildings. I was not satisfied with the Mahotsava

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I have got all the news from your letter and have replied to
your wire already. Niranjan and Govindalal Shah will wait at Kathgodam
for Yogen-Ma. After I reached Naini Tal, Baburam went from here to
Naini Tal<!--'Volume 8 Page 452'--> on horseback against
everybody's advice, and while returning, he also accompanied us on
horseback. I was far behind as I was in a Dandi. When I reached the dak
bungalow at night, I heard that Baburam had again fallen from the horse
and had hurt one of his arms &#8212; though he had no fractures. Lest I
should rebuke him, he stayed in a private lodging house. Because of his
fall, Miss MacLeod gave him her Dandi and herself came on the horse. He
did not meet me that night. Next day I was making arrangements for a
Dandi for him, when I heard that he had already left on foot. Since
then I have not heard of him. I have wired to one or two places, but no
news. Perhaps he is putting up at some village. Very well! They are
experts in increasing one's worries. </p>
<p>There will be a Dandi for Yogen-Ma; but all the rest will have
to go on foot. </p>
<p>My health is much better, but the dyspepsia has not gone, and
again insomnia has set in. It will be very helpful if you can soon send
some good Ayurvedic medicine for dyspepsia. </p>
<p>Since only one or two sporadic cases of plague have occurred
there, there is plenty of accommodation in the Government plague
hospital, and there is a talk of having hospitals in every Ward. Taking
all this into consideration, do what the situation demands. But
remember that something said by somebody in Baghbazar does not
constitute public opinion. . . . Take care that funds do not run short
in times of need and that there is no waste of money. For the present
buy a plot of ground for Ramlal in the name of Raghuvir (The family
deity of Shri Ramakrishna's birthplace, Kamarpukur, Ramlal being his
nephew.) after careful consideration. . . . Holy Mother will be the
Sebâit (worshipper-in-charge); after her will come Ramlal, and Shibu
will succeed them as Sebait; or make any other arrangement that<!--'Volume 8 Page 453'-->
seems best. You can, if you think it right, begin the construction of
the building even now. For it is not good to live in a new house for
the first one or two months, as it will be damp. . . . The anti-erosion
wall can be completed afterwards. I am trying to raise money for the
magazine. See that the sum of Rs. 1,200 which I gave for the magazine
is kept only for that account. </p>
<p>All the others are well here. Sadananda sprained his foot
yesterday. He says he will be all right by the evening. The climate at
Almora is excellent at this time. Moreover the bungalow rented by
Sevier is the best in Almora. On the opposite side Annie Besant is
staying in a small bungalow with Chakravarty. Chakravarty is now the
son-in-law of Gagan (of Ghazipur). One day I went to see him. Annie
Besant told me entreatingly that there should be friendship between her
organisation and mine all over the world, etc., etc. Today Besant will
come here for tea. Our ladies are in a small bungalow near by and are
quite happy. Only Miss MacLeod is a little unwell today. Harry Sevier
is becoming more and more a Sadhu as the days pass by. . . . Brother
Hari sends you his greetings and Sadananda, Ajoy, and Suren send you

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>I got all the news from your letter. . . . My opinion
regarding what you have written about Sarada is only that it is
difficult to make a magazine in Bengali paying; but if all of you
together canvass subscribers from door to door, it may be possible. In
this matter do as you all decide. Poor Sarada has already been
disappointed once. What harm is there if we lose a thousand rupees by
supporting such an unselfish and very hardworking person? What about
the printing of <i>Raja-Yoga</i>? As a last resort, you
may give it to Upen on certain terms of sharing the profit in the
sales. . . . About money matters, the advice given previously is final.
Henceforward do what you consider best regarding expenditure and other
things. I see very well that my policy is wrong, and yours is correct,
regarding helping others; that is to say, if you help with money too
much at a time, people instead of feeling grateful remark on the
contrary that<!--'Volume 8 Page 455'--> they have got a
simpleton to bank upon. I always lost sight of the demoralising
influence of charity on the receiver. Secondly, we have no right to
deviate even slightly from the purposes for which we collect the
donations. Mrs. Bull will get her rosary all right if you send it care
of Chief Justice Rishibar Mukhopadhyaya, Kashmir. Mr. Mitra and the
Chief Justice are taking every care of them. We could not get a plot of
ground in Kashmir yet, but there is a chance that we shall do so soon.
If you can spend a winter here, you are sure to recoup your health. If
the house is a good one and if you have enough fuel and warm clothing,
then life in a land of snow is nothing but enjoyable. Also for stomach
troubles a cold climate is an unfailing remedy. Bring Yogen with you;
for the earth here is not stony, it is clay like that of Bengal. </p>
<p>If the paper is brought out in Almora, the work will progress
much; for poor Sevier will have something to do, and the local people
also will get some work. Skilful management lies in giving every man
work after his own heart. By all the means in our power the Nivedita
Girls' School in Calcutta should be put on a firm footing. To bring
Master Mahashay to Kashmir is still a far cry, for it will be long
before a college is established here. But he has written that it is
possible to start a college in Calcutta, with him as the principal, at
an initial expense of a thousand rupees. I hear that you all also
favour this proposal. In this matter do what you all consider best. My
health is all right. I have to get up seldom at night, even though I
take twice a day rice and potatoes, sugar, or whatever I get. Medicine
is useless &#8212; it has no action on the system of a Knower of Brahman!
Everything will be digested &#8212; don't be afraid. </p>

<p>MY DEAR RAKHAL, </p>
<p>You are always under a delusion, and it does not leave you
because of the strong influence, good or bad, of other brains. It is
this: whenever I write to you about accounts, you feel that I have no
confidence in you. . . . My great anxiety is this: the work has somehow
been started, but it should go on and progress even when we are not
here; such thoughts worry me day and night. Any amount of theoretical
knowledge one may have; but unless one does the thing actually, nothing
is learnt. I refer repeatedly to election, accounts, and discussion so
that everybody may be prepared to shoulder the work. If one man dies,
another &#8212; why another only, ten if necessary &#8212; should be ready to take
it up. Secondly, if a man's interest in a thing is not roused, he will
not work whole-heartedly; all should be made to understand that
everyone has a share in the work and property, and a voice in the
management. This should be done while there is yet time. Give a
responsible position to everyone alternately, but keep a watchful eye
so that you can control when necessary; thus only can men be trained
for the work. Set up such a machine as will go on automatically, no
matter who dies or lives. We Indians suffer from a great defect, viz we
cannot make a permanent organisation &#8212; and the reason is that we<!--'Volume 8 Page 457'-->
never like to share power with others and never think of what will come
after we are gone. </p>
<p>I have already written everything regarding the plague. Mrs.
Bull and Miss Müller and others are of opinion that it is not desirable
to spend money uselessly when hospitals have been started in every
Ward. We lend our services as nurses and the like. Those that pay the
piper must command the tune. </p>
<p>The Maharaja of Kashmir has agreed to give us a plot of land.
I have also visited the site. Now the matter will be finalised in a few
days, if the Lord wills. Right now, before leaving, I hope to build a
small house here. I shall leave it in the charge of Justice Mukherjee
when departing. Why not come here with somebody else and spend the
winter? Your health will improve, and a need, too, will be fulfilled.
The money I have set apart for the press will be sufficient for the
purpose, but all will be as you decide. This time I shall surely get
some money from N.W.P., Rajputana, and other places. Well, give as
directed . . . money to a few persons. I am borrowing this amount from
the Math and will pay it back to you with interest. </p>

<p>This will be for a month or so, when by that time our good

Purgatory in Japan? And regain Paradise once more in the U.S. of
America. This is what Pumpkin Swami, brother of the Coomra Swami,

MY DEAR HARIPADA,

In Kashmir my health has completely broken down, and I have not witnessed the Durga-Puja for the last nine years; so I am starting for Calcutta. I have for the present given up the plan of going to America. I think I shall have plenty of time to go to Karachi during the winter.

My brother-disciple Saradananda will send Rs. 50/- from Lahore to Karachi. Don't yield to sorrow — everything is in God's hands. Certainly I won't go anywhere this year without meeting all of you. My blessings to all.","Yours affectionately,VIVEKANANDA.",,98,2,0

heard a few months ago, when I was rather worrying over your long

<h2>CXXXIX</h2>
<p class=""center""><i>To Miss Marie Halboister</i></p>
<p class=""right"">C/O MISS NOBLE, <br>
21A HIGH STREET, WIMBLEDON. <br>
<i>August, 1899</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARIE, </p>
<p>I am in London again. This time not busy, not hustling about
but quietly settled down in a corner &#8212; waiting to start for the U.S.
America on the first opportunity. My friends are nearly all out of
London in the country and elsewhere, and my health not sufficiently
strong. </p>
<p>So you are happy in the midst of your lakes and gardens and
seclusion in Canada. I am glad, so glad to know that you are up again
on top of the tide. May you remain there for ever! </p>
<p>You could not finish the<i> Raja-Yoga</i>
translation yet &#8212; all right, there is no hurry. Time and opportunity
must come if it is to be done you know, otherwise we vainly strive. </p>
<p>Canada must be beautiful now, with its short but vigorous
summer, and very healthy. </p>
<p>I expect to be in New York in a few weeks, and don't know what
next. I hope to come back to England next spring. </p>
<p>I fervently wish no misery ever came near anyone; yet it is
that alone that gives us an insight into the depths of our lives, does
it not? </p>
<p>In our moments of anguish, gates barred for ever seem to open
and let in many a flood of light. </p>
<p>We learn as we grow. Alas! we cannot use our<!--'Volume 8 Page 467'-->
knowledge here. The moment we seem to learn, we are hurried off the
stage. And this is Mâyâ! </p>
<p>This toy world would not be here, this play could not go on,
if we were knowing players. We must play blindfolded. Some of us have
taken the part of the rogue of the play, some heroic &#8212; never mind, it
is all play. This is the only consolation. There are demons and lions
and tigers and what not on the stage, but they are all muzzled. They
snap but cannot bite. The world cannot touch our souls. If you want,
even if the body be torn and bleeding, you may enjoy the greatest peace
in your mind. </p>
<p>And the way to that is to attain hopelessness. Do you know
that? Not the imbecile attitude of despair, but the contempt of the
conqueror for things he has attained, for things he struggled for and
then throws aside as beneath his worth. </p>
<p>This hopelessness, desirelessness, aimlessness, is just the
harmony with nature. In nature there is no harmony, no reason, no
sequence; it was chaos before, it is so still. </p>
<p>The lowest man is in consonance with nature in his
earthy-headness; the highest the same in the fullness of knowledge. All
three aimless, drifting, hopeless &#8212; all three happy. </p>
<p>You want a chatty letter, don't you? I have not much to chat
about. Mr. Sturdy came last two days. He goes home in Wales tomorrow. </p>
<p>I have to book my passage for N.Y. in a day or two. </p>
<p>None of my old friends have I seen yet except Miss Souter and
Max Gysic, who are in London. They have been very kind, as they always
were. </p>
<p>I have no news to give you, as I know nothing of London yet. I
don't know where Gertrude Orchard is, else would have written to her.
Miss Kate Steel is also away. She is coming on Thursday or Saturday. </p>

MY DEAR MARIE,

I am in London again. This time not busy, not hustling about but quietly settled down in a corner — waiting to start for the U.S. America on the first opportunity. My friends are nearly all out of London in the country and elsewhere, and my health not sufficiently strong.

So you are happy in the midst of your lakes and gardens and seclusion in Canada. I am glad, so glad to know that you are up again on top of the tide. May you remain there for ever!

You could not finish theRaja-Yogatranslation yet — all right, there is no hurry. Time and opportunity must come if it is to be done you know, otherwise we vainly strive.

Canada must be beautiful now, with its short but vigorous summer, and very healthy.

I expect to be in New York in a few weeks, and don't know what next. I hope to come back to England next spring.

I fervently wish no misery ever came near anyone; yet it is that alone that gives us an insight into the depths of our lives, does it not?

In our moments of anguish, gates barred for ever seem to open and let in many a flood of light.

We learn as we grow. Alas! we cannot use ourknowledge here. The moment we seem to learn, we are hurried off the stage. And this is Mâyâ!

This toy world would not be here, this play could not go on, if we were knowing players. We must play blindfolded. Some of us have taken the part of the rogue of the play, some heroic — never mind, it is all play. This is the only consolation. There are demons and lions and tigers and what not on the stage, but they are all muzzled. They snap but cannot bite. The world cannot touch our souls. If you want, even if the body be torn and bleeding, you may enjoy the greatest peace in your mind.

And the way to that is to attain hopelessness. Do you know that? Not the imbecile attitude of despair, but the contempt of the conqueror for things he has attained, for things he struggled for and then throws aside as beneath his worth.

This hopelessness, desirelessness, aimlessness, is just the harmony with nature. In nature there is no harmony, no reason, no sequence; it was chaos before, it is so still.

The lowest man is in consonance with nature in his earthy-headness; the highest the same in the fullness of knowledge. All three aimless, drifting, hopeless — all three happy.

You want a chatty letter, don't you? I have not much to chat about. Mr. Sturdy came last two days. He goes home in Wales tomorrow.

I have to book my passage for N.Y. in a day or two.

None of my old friends have I seen yet except Miss Souter and Max Gysic, who are in London. They have been very kind, as they always were.

I have no news to give you, as I know nothing of London yet. I don't know where Gertrude Orchard is, else would have written to her. Miss Kate Steel is also away. She is coming on Thursday or Saturday.

I had an invitation to stay in Paris with a friend, avery well-educated Frenchman, but I could not go this time. I hope another time to live with him some days.

I expect to see some of our old friends and say good day to them.

I hope to see you in America sure. Either I may unexpectedly turn up in Ottawa in my peregrinations or you come to N.Y.

Good-bye, all luck be yours.","Ever yours in the Lord,VIVEKANANDA.",,620,5,0

no expenditure will be made which is not countersigned by them &#8212; none

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

I got a lot of news from your letter. My health was much better on the ship, but, after landing, owing to flatulence it is rather bad now. . . .

<p class=""center""><i>To Miss Mary Hale</i></p>
<p class=""right"">RIDGELY MANOR, <br>
<i>September 1899</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>Yes, I have arrived. I had a letter from Isabelle from
Greenacre. I hope to see her soon and Harriet. Harriet Woolley has been
uniformly silent. Never mind, I will bide my time, and as soon as Mr.
Woolley becomes a millionaire, demand my money. You did not write any
particulars about Mother Church and Father Pope, only the news of
something about me in some newspapers. I have long ceased to take any
interest in papers; only they keep me before the public and get a sale
of my books ""anyway"" as you say. Do you know what I am trying to do
now? Writing a book on India and her people &#8212; a short chatty simple
something. Again I am going to learn French. If I fail to do it this
year, I cannot ""do"" the Paris Exposition next year properly. Well, I
expect to learn much French here where even the servants talk it. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 473'-->
<p>You never saw Mrs. Leggett, did you? She is simply grand. I am
going to Paris next year as their guest, as I did the first time. </p>
<p>I have now got a monastery on the Ganga for the teaching of
philosophy and comparative religion and a centre of work. </p>
<p>What have you been doing all this time? Reading? Writing? You
did not do anything. You could have written lots by this time. Even if
you had taught me French, I would be quite a Froggy now, <i>and
you did not</i>, only made me talk nonsense. You never went to
Greenacre. I hope it is getting strength every year. </p>
<p>Say, you 24 feet and 600 lbs. of Christian Science, you could
not pull me up with your treatments. I am losing much faith in your
healing powers. Where is Sam? ""Bewaring"" all this time as he could;
bless his heart, such a noble boy! </p>
<p>I was growing grey fast, but somehow it got checked. I am
sorry, only a few grey hairs now; a research will unearth many though.
I like it and am going to cultivate a long white goaty. Mother Church
and Father Pope were having a fine time on the continent. I saw a bit
on my way home. And you have been Cinderella-ing in Chicago &#8212; good for
you. Persuade the old folks to go to Paris next year and take you
along. There must be wonderful sights to see; the French are making a
last great struggle, they say, before closing business. </p>
<p>Well, you did not write me long, long. You do not deserve this
letter, but &#8212; I am so good you know, especially as death is drawing
near &#8212; I do not want to quarrel with anyone. I am dying to see Isabelle
and Harriet. I hope they have got a great supply of healing power at
Greenacre Inn and will help me out of my present fall. In my days the
Inn was well stored with spiritual food, and less of material stuff. Do
you know anything of osteopathy? Here is one in New York working
wonders really. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 474'-->
<p>I am going to have my bones searched by him in a week. Where
is Miss Howe? She is such a noble soul, such a friend. By the by, Mary,
it is curious your family, Mother Church and her clergy, both monastic
and secular, have made more impression on me than any family I know of.
Lord bless you ever and ever. </p>
<p>I am taking rest now, and the Leggetts are so kind. I feel
perfectly at home. I intend to go to New York to see the Dewy
procession. I have not seen my friends there. </p>
<p>Write me all about yourselves. I so long to hear. You know Joe
Joe of course. I marred their visit to India with my constant
break-downs, and they were so good, so forgiving. For years Mrs. Bull
and she have been my guardian angels. Mrs. Bull is expected here next
week. </p>
<p>She would have been here before this, but her daughter (Olea)
had a spell of illness. She suffered much, but is now out of danger.
Mrs. Bull has taken one of Leggett's cottages here, and if the cold
weather does not set in faster than usual, we are going to have a
delightful month here even now. The place is so beautiful &#8212; well wooded
and perfect lawns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried to play golf the other day; I do not think it difficult at all
&#8212; only it requires good practice. You never went to Philadelphia to
visit your golfing friends? What are your plans? What do you intend to
do the rest of your life? Have you thought out any work? Write me a
long letter, will you? I saw a lady in the streets of Naples as I was
passing, going along with three others, must be Americans, so like you
that I was almost going to speak to her; when I came near I saw my

MY DEAR MARY,

Yes, I have arrived. I had a letter from Isabelle from Greenacre. I hope to see her soon and Harriet. Harriet Woolley has been uniformly silent. Never mind, I will bide my time, and as soon as Mr. Woolley becomes a millionaire, demand my money. You did not write any particulars about Mother Church and Father Pope, only the news of something about me in some newspapers. I have long ceased to take any interest in papers; only they keep me before the public and get a sale of my books ""anyway"" as you say. Do you know what I am trying to do now? Writing a book on India and her people — a short chatty simple something. Again I am going to learn French. If I fail to do it this year, I cannot ""do"" the Paris Exposition next year properly. Well, I expect to learn much French here where even the servants talk it.

You never saw Mrs. Leggett, did you? She is simply grand. I am going to Paris next year as their guest, as I did the first time.

I have now got a monastery on the Ganga for the teaching of philosophy and comparative religion and a centre of work.

What have you been doing all this time? Reading? Writing? You did not do anything. You could have written lots by this time. Even if you had taught me French, I would be quite a Froggy now,and you did not, only made me talk nonsense. You never went to Greenacre. I hope it is getting strength every year.

Say, you 24 feet and 600 lbs. of Christian Science, you could not pull me up with your treatments. I am losing much faith in your healing powers. Where is Sam? ""Bewaring"" all this time as he could; bless his heart, such a noble boy!

I was growing grey fast, but somehow it got checked. I am sorry, only a few grey hairs now; a research will unearth many though. I like it and am going to cultivate a long white goaty. Mother Church and Father Pope were having a fine time on the continent. I saw a bit on my way home. And you have been Cinderella-ing in Chicago — good for you. Persuade the old folks to go to Paris next year and take you along. There must be wonderful sights to see; the French are making a last great struggle, they say, before closing business.

Well, you did not write me long, long. You do not deserve this letter, but — I am so good you know, especially as death is drawing near — I do not want to quarrel with anyone. I am dying to see Isabelle and Harriet. I hope they have got a great supply of healing power at Greenacre Inn and will help me out of my present fall. In my days the Inn was well stored with spiritual food, and less of material stuff. Do you know anything of osteopathy? Here is one in New York working wonders really.

I am going to have my bones searched by him in a week. Where is Miss Howe? She is such a noble soul, such a friend. By the by, Mary, it is curious your family, Mother Church and her clergy, both monastic and secular, have made more impression on me than any family I know of. Lord bless you ever and ever.

I am taking rest now, and the Leggetts are so kind. I feel perfectly at home. I intend to go to New York to see the Dewy procession. I have not seen my friends there.

Write me all about yourselves. I so long to hear. You know Joe Joe of course. I marred their visit to India with my constant break-downs, and they were so good, so forgiving. For years Mrs. Bull and she have been my guardian angels. Mrs. Bull is expected here next week.

She would have been here before this, but her daughter (Olea) had a spell of illness. She suffered much, but is now out of danger. Mrs. Bull has taken one of Leggett's cottages here, and if the cold weather does not set in faster than usual, we are going to have a delightful month here even now. The place is so beautiful — well wooded and perfect lawns.

I tried to play golf the other day; I do not think it difficult at all — only it requires good practice. You never went to Philadelphia to visit your golfing friends? What are your plans? What do you intend to do the rest of your life? Have you thought out any work? Write me a long letter, will you? I saw a lady in the streets of Naples as I was passing, going along with three others, must be Americans, so like you that I was almost going to speak to her; when I came near I saw my mistake. Good-bye for the present. Write sharp. . . .","Ever your affectionate brother,

<p>MY DEAR OPTIMIST, </p>
<p>I received your letter and am thankful that something has come
to force optimistic <i>laissez faire</i> into action. Your
questions have tapped the very source of pessimism, however. British
rule in modern India has only one redeeming feature, though
unconscious; it has brought India out once more on the stage of the
world; it has forced upon it the contact of the outside world. If it
had been done with an eye to the good of the people concerned, as
circumstances favoured Japan with, the results could have been more
wonderful for India. No<!--'Volume 8 Page 476'--> good can
be done when the main idea is blood-sucking. On the whole the old
regime was better for the people, as it <i>did not</i>
take away everything they had, and there was some justice, some
liberty. </p>
<p>A few hundred, modernised, half-educated, and denationalised
men are all the show of modern English India &#8212; <i>nothing else</i>.
The Hindus were 600 million in number according to Ferishta, the
Mohammedan historian, in the 12th century &#8212; now less than 200 million. </p>
<p>In spite of the centuries of anarchy that reigned during the
struggles of the English to conquer, the terrible massacre the English
perpetrated in 1857 and 1858, and the still more terrible famines that
have become the inevitable consequence of British rule (there never is
a famine in a native state) and that take off millions, there has been
a good increase of population, but not yet what it was when the country
was entirely independent &#8212; that is, before the Mohammedan rule. Indian
labour and produce can support five times as many people as there are
now in India with comfort, if the whole thing is not taken off from
them. </p>
<p>This is the state of things &#8212; even education will no more be
permitted to spread; freedom of the press stopped already, (of course
we have been disarmed long ago), the bit of self-government granted to

I? Suppose you simply publish this letter &#8212; the law<!--'Volume 8 Page 477'-->

me from here to India and kill me without trial. And I know all your

I also go to sleep and become optimistic? Nero was the greatest
optimistic person! They don't think it worth while to write these

BELOVED DHIRA MATA,

An eventful and happy New Year to you and many such returns!

I am much better in health — able enough to work once more. I have started work already and have sent to Saradananda some money — Rs. 1,300 already — as expenses for the law suit. I shall send more, if they need it. I had a very bad dream this morning and had not any news of Saradananda for three weeks. Poor boys! How hard I am on them at times.

If I die, kindly send that money to my mother. I wired to the boys three weeks ago that I was perfectly cured. If I don't get any worse, this much health as I have now will do well enough. Do not worry at all on my account; I am up and working with a will.

I am sorry I could not write any more of the stories. I have written some other things and mean to write something almost every day.

I am very much more peaceful and find that the only way to keep my peace is to teach others. Work is my only safety valve.

I only want some clear business head to take care of the details as I push onwards and work on. I am afraid it will be a long time to find such in India, and if thereare any, they ought to be educated by somebody from the West.

Again, I can only work when thrown completely on my own feet. I am at my best when I am alone. Mother seems to arrange so. Joe believes great things are brewing — in Mother's cup; hope it is so.

Joe and Margot have developed into actual prophets, it seems. I can only say, every blow I had in this life, every pang, will only become joyful sacrifice if Mother becomes propitious to India once more.

Miss Greenstidel writes a beautiful letter to me, about you most of it. She thinks a lot about Turiyananda too. Give Turiyananda my love. I am sure he will work well. He has the pluck and stamina.

Whether it is magnetic healing, California ozone, or the end of the present spell of bad Karma, I am improving. It is a great thing to be able to walk three miles, even after a heavy dinner.

All love and blessings to Olea. My love to Dr. Janes and other Boston friends.","Ever your son,VIVEKANANDA.",,565,3,0

<p>MY DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and many, many glorious
returns of such for your birthday. All these wishes, prayers, greetings
in one breath. I am cured, you will be glad to know. It was only
indigestion and no heart or kidney affection, quoth the healers;
nothing more. And I am walking three miles a day &#8212; after a heavy
dinner. </p>
<p>Say &#8212; the person healing me insisted on my smoking! So I am
having my pipe nicely and am all the better for it. In plain English
the nervousness etc. was all due to dyspepsia and nothing more. </p>
<p>. . . I am at work too; working, working, not hard; but I
don't care, and I want to make money this time. Tell this to Margot,
especially the pipe business. You know who is healing me? No physician,
no Christian Science healer, but a magnetic healing woman who skins me
every time she treats me. Wonders &#8212; she performs operations by rubbing
&#8212; internal operations too, her patients tell me. </p>
<p>It is getting late in the night. I have to give up writing
separate letters to Margot, Harriet, Isabelle, and Mother Church. Wish
is half the work. They all know how I love them dearly, <i>passionately</i>;
so you become the medium for my spirit for the time, and carry them my
New Year's messages. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 488'-->
<p>It is exactly like Northern Indian winter here, only some days
a little warmer; the roses are here and the beautiful palms. Barley is
in the fields, roses and many other flowers round about the cottage
where I live. Mrs. Blodgett, my host, is a Chicago lady &#8212; fat, old, and
extremely witty. She heard me in Chicago and is very motherly. </p>
<p>I am so sorry, the English have caught a Tartar in South
Africa. A soldier on duty outside a camp bawled out that he had caught
a Tartar. ""Bring him in"", was the order from inside the tent. ""He will
not come"", replied the sentry. ""Then you come yourself"", rang the order
again. ""He will not let me come either"". Hence the phrase ""to catch a
Tartar"". Don't you catch any. </p>
<p>I am happy just now and hope to remain so for all the rest of
my life. Just now I am Christian Science &#8212; no evil, and ""love is a
drawing card"". </p>
<p>I shall be very happy if I can make a lot of money. I am
making some. Tell Margot, I am going to make a lot of money and go home
by way of Japan, Honolulu, China, and Java. This is a nice place to
make money quick in; and San Francisco is better, I hear. Has she made
any? </p>
<p>You could not get the millionaire. Why don't you start for
half or one-fourth million? Something is better than nothing. We want
money; he may go into Lake Michigan, we have not the least objection.

<h2>CLIV</h2>
<p class=""center""><i>To Mrs. Ole Bull</i></p>
<p class=""right""><i>17th January, 1900</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR DHIRA MATA,</p>
<p>I received yours with the enclosures for Saradananda; and
there was some good news. I hope to get some more news this week. You
did not write anything about your plans. I had a letter from Miss
Greenstidel expressing her deep gratitude for your kindness &#8212; and who
does not? Turiyananda is getting well by this time, I hope. </p>
<p>I have been able to remit Rs. 2,000 to Saradananda, with the
help of Miss MacLeod and Mrs. Leggett. Of course they contributed the
best part. The rest was got by lectures. I do not expect anything much
here or anywhere by lecturing. I can scarcely make expenses. No, not
even that; whenever it comes to paying, the people are nowhere. The
field of lecturing in this country has been overworked; the people have
outgrown that. </p>
<p>I am decidedly better in health. The healer thinks I am now at
liberty to go anywhere I choose, the process will go on, and I shall
completely recover in a few months. She insists on this, that I am
cured already; only nature will have to work out the rest. </p>
<p>Well, I came here principally for health. I have got it; in
addition I got Rs. 2,000, to defray the law expenses. Good. </p>
<p>Now it occurs to me that my mission from the platform is
finished, and I need not break my health again by that sort of work. </p>
<p>It is becoming clearer to me that I lay down all the concerns
of the Math and for a time go back to my mother. She has suffered much
through me. I must try to smooth her last days. Do you know, this was
just<!--'Volume 8 Page 490'--> exactly what the great
Shankarâchârya himself had to do! He had to go back to his mother in
the last few days of her life! I accept it, I am resigned. I am calmer
than ever. The only difficulty is the financial part. Well, the Indian
people owe something. I will try Madras and a few other friends in
India. Anyhow, I must try, as I have forebodings that my mother has not
very many years to live. Then again, this is coming to me as the
greatest of all sacrifices to make, the sacrifice of ambition, of
leadership, of fame. I am resigned and must do the penance. The one
thousand dollars with Mr. Leggett and if a little more is collected,
will be enough to fall back upon in case of need. Will you send me back
to India? I am ready any time. Don't go to France without seeing me. I
have become practical at least compared to the visionary dreams of Joe
and Margot. Let them work their dreams out for me &#8212; they are not more
than dreams. I want to make out a trust-deed of the Math in the names
of Saradananda, Brahmananda, and yourself. I will do it as soon as I
get the papers from Saradananda. Then I am quits. I want rest, a meal,
a few books, and I want to do some scholarly work. Mother shows this
light vividly now. Of course you were the one to whom She showed it
first. I would not believe it then. But then, it is now shown that &#8212;
leaving my mother was a great renunciation in 1884 &#8212; it is <i>a
greater renunciation to go back to my mother now</i>. Probably
Mother wants me to undergo the same that She made the great Âchârya
undergo in old days. Is it? I am surer of your guidance than of my own.
Joe and Margot are great souls, but to you Mother is now sending the
light for my guidance. Do you see light? What do you advise? At least
do not go out of this country without sending me home. </p>
<p>I am but a child; what work have I to do? My powers I passed
over to you. I see it. I cannot any<!--'Volume 8 Page 491'-->
more <i>tell</i> from the platform. Don't tell it to
anyone &#8212; not even to Joe. I am glad. I want rest; not that I am tired,
but the next phase will be the <i>miraculous touch and not the
tongue</i> &#8212; like Ramakrishna's. The <i>word</i> has
gone to you and the voice to Margo. No more it is in me. I am glad. I
am resigned. Only get me out to India, won't you? Mother will make you
do it. I am sure. </p>

<p>Before this reaches you, I am off to San Francisco. You
already know all about the work. I have not done much work, but my

up, being alone. Strange, but that is what Mother wants me to be.
""Wandering alone like the rhinoceros"", as Joe likes it. I think the
conferences are ended. Poor Turiyananda suffered so much and never let
me know; he is so strong and good. Poor Niranjan, I learn from Mrs.
Sevier, is so<!--'Volume 8 Page 492'--> seriously ill in

<p>MY DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>Your letter bearing the sad news of Mr. Hale's passing away
reached me yesterday. I am sorry, because in spite of monastic
training, the heart lives on; and then Mr. Hale was one of the best
souls I met in life. Of course you are sorry, miserable, and so are
Mother Church and Harriet and the rest, especially as this is the first
grief of its kind you have met, is it not? I have lost many, suffered
much, and the most curious cause of suffering when somebody goes off is
the feeling that I was not good enough to that person. When my father
died, it was a pang for months, and I had been so disobedient. You have
been very dutiful; if you feel anything like that, it is only a form of
sorrow. </p>
<p>Just now I am afraid life begins for you, Mary, in earnest. We
may read books, hear lectures, and talk miles, but experience is the
one teacher, the one eye-opener.<!--'Volume 8 Page 493'-->
It is best as it is. We learn, through smiles and tears we learn. We
don't know why, but we see it is so; and that is enough. Of course
Mother Church has the solace of her religion. I wish we could all dream
undisturbed good dreams. </p>
<p>You have had shelter all your life. I was in the glare,
burning and panting all the time. Now for a moment you have caught a
glimpse of the other side. My life is made up of continuous blows like
that, and hundred times worse, because of poverty, treachery, and my
own foolishness! Pessimism! You will understand it, how it comes. Well,
well, what shall I say to you, Mary? You know all the talks; only I say

<p>Very kind of you to write to invite me to Chicago. I wish I
could be there this minute. But I am busy making money; only I do not
make much. Well, I have to make enough to pay my passage home at any

<p>Of course money making is slow and tedious. If I could make a
few hundreds, I would be only too glad.<!--'Volume 8 Page 494'-->

<p>How are you all? Give Mother my heartfelt love. I wish I had
her strength, she is a true Christian. My health is much better, but
the old strength is not there yet. I hope it will come some day, but
then, one had to work so hard to do the least little thing. I wish I
had rest and peace for a few days at least, which I am sure I can get
with the sisters at Chicago. Well, Mother knows best, as I say always.
She knows best. The last two years have been specially bad. I have been
living in mental hell. It is partially lifted now, and I hope for
better days, better states. All blessings on you and the sisters and
Mother. Mary, you have been always the sweetest notes in my jarring and
clashing life. Then you had the great good Karma to start without
oppressive surroundings. I never know a moment's peaceful life. It has
always been high pressure, mentally. Lord bless you. </p>

come in big crowds. But it remains to be seen how much of that
enthusiasm endures when it comes to paying at the door. Rev. Benjamin
Fay Mills invited me to Oakland and gave me<!--'Volume 8 Page 495'-->
big crowds to preach to. He and his wife have been reading my works and

introduction from Miss Thursby to Mrs. Hearst. She has invited me to
one of her musicals Sunday next. </p>
<p>My health is about the same; don't find much difference; it is
improving, perhaps, but very imperceptibly. I can use my voice,
however, to make 3,000 people hear me, as I did twice in Oakland, and
get good sleep too after two hours of speaking. </p>
<p>I learn Margot is with you. When are you sailing for France? I
will leave here in April and go to the East. I am very desirous of
getting to England in May if I can. Must not go home before trying
England once more. </p>
<p>I have nice letters from Brahmananda and Saradananda; they are
all doing well. They are trying to bring the municipality to its
senses; I am glad. In this world of Maya one need not injure, but
""spread the hood, without striking"". That is enough. </p>

SAN FRANCISCO, <br>
<i>7th March, 1900</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DHIRA MATA, </p>
<p>Your letter, enclosing one from Saradananda only and the
accounts, came. I am very much reassured by all the<!--'Volume 8 Page 496'-->
news I since received from India. As for the accounts and the disposal
of the Rs. 30,000, do just what you please. I have given over the
management to you, the Master will show you what is best to do. The
money is Rs. 35,000; the Rs. 5,000, for building the cottage on the
Ganga, I wrote to Saradananda not to use just now. I have already taken
Rs. 5,000 of that money. I am not going to take more. I had paid back
Rs. 2,000 or more of that Rs. 5,000 in India. But it seems,
Brahmananda, wanting to show as much of the Rs. 35,000 intact as he
could, drew upon my Rs. 2,000; so I owe them Rs. 5,000 still on that
score. </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I could make money here in California and
pay them up quietly. Now I have entirely failed in California
financially. It is worse here than in Los Angeles. They come in crowds
when there is a free lecture and very few when there is something to
pay. </p>
<p>I have some hopes yet in England. It is necessary for me to
reach England in May. There is not the least use in breaking my health
in San Francisco for nothing. Moreover, with all Joe's enthusiasm, I
have not yet found any real benefit from the magnetic healer, except a
few red patches on my chest from scratching! Platform work is nigh gone
for me, and forcing it is only hastening the end. I leave here very
soon, as soon as I can make money for a passage. I have 300 dollars in
hand, made in Los Angeles. I will lecture here next week and then I
stop. As for the Math and the money, the sooner I am released of that
burden the better. </p>
<p>I am ready to do whatever you advise me to do. You have been a
real mother to me. You have taken up one of my great burdens on
yourself &#8212; I mean my poor cousin. I feel quite satisfied. As for my
mother, I am going back to her &#8212; for my last days and hers. The
thousand dollars I have in New York will bring Rs. 9 a month; then I<!--'Volume 8 Page 497'-->
bought for her a bit of land which will bring about Rs. 6; and her old
house &#8212; that will bring, say, Rs. 6. I leave the house under litigation
out of consideration, as I have not got it. Myself, my mother, my
grandmother, and my brother will live on Rs. 20 a month easy. I would
start just now, if I could make money for a passage to India, without
touching the 1,000 dollars in New York. </p>
<p>Anyhow I will scrape three or four hundred dollars &#8212; 400
dollars will be enough for a second class passage and for a few weeks'
stay in London. I do not ask you to do anything more for me; I do not
want it. What you have done is more, ever so much more than I deserve.
I have given my place solemnly to you in Shri Ramakrishna's work. I am
out of it. All my life I have been a torture to my poor mother. Her
whole life has been one of continuous misery. If it be possible, my
last attempt should be to make her a little happy. I have planned it
all out. I have served the <i>Mother</i> all my life. It
is done; I refuse now to grind Her axe. Let Her find other workers &#8212; I
strike. </p>
<p>You have been one friend with whom Shri Ramakrishna has become
the goal of life &#8212; that is the secret of my trust in you. Others love
me personally. But they little dream that what they love me for is
Ramakrishna; leaving Him, I am only a mass of foolish selfish emotions.
Anyway this stress is terrible, thinking of what may come next, wishing
what ought to come next. I am unequal to the responsibility; I am found
wanting. I must give up this work. If the work has not life in it, let
it die; if it has, it need not wait for poor workers like myself. </p>
<p>Now the money, Rs. 30,000, is in my name, in Government
Securities. If they are sold now, we shall lose fearfully, on account
of the war; then, how can they be sent over here without being sold
there? To sell them there I must sign them. I do not know how all this
is going to be straightened out. Do what you think best<!--'Volume 8 Page 498'-->
about it all. In the meanwhile, it is absolutely necessary that I
execute a will in your favour for everything, in case I suddenly die.
Send me a draft will as soon as possible and I shall register it in San
Francisco or Chicago; then my conscience will be safe. I don't know any
lawyer here, else I would have got it drawn up; neither have I the
money. The will must be done immediately; the trust and things have
time enough for them. </p>

reached me yesterday. I saw a copy of the invitation letters for the
birthday anniversary of Gurudeva (Divine Master). I am frightened
hearing that Sharat is troubled by rheumatism. Alas, sickness, sorrow,
and pain have been my companions for the last two years. Tell Sharat
that I am not going to work so hard any more. But he who does not work
enough to earn his food will have to starve to death! . . . I hope
Durgaprasanna has done by this time whatever was necessary for the
compound wall. . . . The raising of a compound wall is not, after all,
a difficult thing. If I can, I shall build a small house there and
serve my old grandmother and mother. Evil actions leave none scot-free;
Mother never spares anybody. I admit my actions have been wrong. Now,
brother, all of you are Sâdhus and great saints, kindly pray to the
Mother that I do not have to shoulder all this trouble and burden any
longer. Now I desire a little peace &#8212; it seems there is no more
strength left to bear the burden of work and responsibility &#8212; rest and
peace for the few days that I shall yet live! Victory to the Guru!
Victory to the Guru! . . . No more lectures or anything of that sort.
Peace! </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 500'-->
<p>As soon as Sharat sends the trust-deed of the Math, I shall
put my signature to it. You all manage &#8212; truly I require rest. This
disease is called neurasthenia, a disease of the nerves. Once it comes,
it continues for some years. But after a complete rest for three or
four years it is cured. This country is the home of the disease, and
here it has caught me. However, it is not only no fatal disease, but it
makes a man live long. Don't be anxious on my account. I shall go on
rolling. But there is only this sorrow that the work of Gurudeva is not
progressing; there is this regret that I have not been able to
accomplish anything of his work. How much I abuse you all and speak
harshly! I am the worst of men! Today, on the anniversary of his
birthday, put the dust of your feet on my head &#8212; and my mind will
become steady again. Victory to the Guru! Victory to the Guru! You are
my only refuge &#8212; you are my only refuge! Now that my mind is steady,
let me tell you that this resignation is the permanent attitude of my
mind. All other moods that come are, you should know, only disease.
Please don't allow me to work at all any longer. Now I shall quietly do
Japa and meditation for some time &#8212; nothing more. Mother knows all
else. Victory to the Mother of the Universe!</p>

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

I got a letter from you some time ago. A letter from Sharat reached me yesterday. I saw a copy of the invitation letters for the birthday anniversary of Gurudeva (Divine Master). I am frightened hearing that Sharat is troubled by rheumatism. Alas, sickness, sorrow, and pain have been my companions for the last two years. Tell Sharat that I am not going to work so hard any more. But he who does not work enough to earn his food will have to starve to death! . . . I hope Durgaprasanna has done by this time whatever was necessary for the compound wall. . . . The raising of a compound wall is not, after all, a difficult thing. If I can, I shall build a small house there and serve my old grandmother and mother. Evil actions leave none scot-free; Mother never spares anybody. I admit my actions have been wrong. Now, brother, all of you are Sâdhus and great saints, kindly pray to the Mother that I do not have to shoulder all this trouble and burden any longer. Now I desire a little peace — it seems there is no more strength left to bear the burden of work and responsibility — rest and peace for the few days that I shall yet live! Victory to the Guru! Victory to the Guru! . . . No more lectures or anything of that sort. Peace!

nonsense! </p>
<p>Things are beginning to hum for me; they will presently roar.
I shall remain quiet though, all the same. Things are not humming for
you just now. I am so sorry, that is, I am trying to be, for I cannot
be sorry for anything and more. I am attaining peace that passeth
understanding, which is neither joy nor sorrow, but something above
them both. Tell Mother that. My passing through the valley of death,
physical, mental, last two years, has helped me in this. Now I am
nearing that <i>Peace</i>, the eternal silence. Now I mean
to see things as they are, everything in that peace, perfect in its

<p>MY DEAR JOE, </p>
<p>Just a line before you start for France. Are you going via
England? I had a beautiful letter from Mrs. Sevier in which I find that
Miss Müller sent simply a paper without any other words to Kali who was
with her in Darjeeling. </p>
<p>Congreave is the name of her nephew, and he is in the
Transvaal war; that is the reason she underlined that, to show her
nephew fighting the Boers in Transvaal. That was all. I cannot

<p>I am physically worse than at Los Angeles, mentally much
better, stronger, and peaceful. Hope it will continue to be so. </p>
<p>I have not got a reply to my letter to you; I expect it soon. </p>
<p>One Indian letter of mine was directed by mistake to Mrs.
Wheeler; it came all right to me in the end. I had nice notes from
Saradananda; they are doing beautifully over there. The boys are
working up; well, scolding has both sides, you see; it makes them up
and doing. We Indians have been so dependent for so long that it
requires, I am sorry, a good lot of tongue to make them active. One of
the laziest fellows had taken charge of the anniversary this year and
pulled it through. They have planned and are successfully working
famine works<!--'Volume 8 Page 509'--> by themselves
without my help. . . . All this comes from the terrific scolding I have
been giving, sure! </p>
<p>They are standing on their own feet. I am so glad. See Joe,
the Mother is working. </p>
<p>I sent Miss Thursby's letter to Mrs. Hearst. She sent me an
invitation to her musical. I could not go. I had a bad cold. So that
was all. Another lady for whom I had a letter from Miss Thursby, an
Oakland lady, did not reply. I don't know whether I shall make enough
in Frisco to pay my fare to Chicago! Oakland work has been successful.
I hope to get about $100 from Oakland, that is all. After all, I am
content. It is better that I tried. . . . Even the magnetic healer had
not anything for me. Well, things will go on anyhow for me; I do not
care how. . . . I am very peaceful. I learn from Los Angeles, Mrs.
Leggett has been bad again. I wired to New York to learn what truth was
in it. I will get a reply soon, I expect. </p>
<p>Say, how will you arrange about my mail when the Leggetts are
over on the other side? Will you so arrange that they reach me right? </p>
<p>I have nothing more to say; all love and gratitude is yours;
already you know that. You have already done more than I ever deserved.

SAN FRANCISCO, <br>
<i>1st April, 1900</i>.</p>
<p>DEAR DHIRA MATA, </p>
<p>Your kind note came this morning. I am so happy to learn that
all the New York friends are being cured by Mrs. Milton. She has been
very unsuccessful, it seems, in Los Angeles, as all the people we
introduced tell me. Some are in a worse state than before the skin
paring. Kindly give Mrs. Milton my love; her rubbings used to do me
good at the time at least. Poor Dr. Hiller! We send him over post-haste
to Los Angeles to get his wife cured. You ought to have seen him the
other morning and heard him too! Mrs. Hiller, it appears, is many times
worse for all the rubbings given; and she is only a few bones; and,
above all, the doctor had to spend 500 dollars in Los Angeles. That
makes him feel very bad. I, of course, would not write this to Joe; she
is happy in her dreams of having done so much good to poor sufferers.
But oh, if she could hear the Los Angeles folks and this old Dr.
Hiller, she would change her mind at once and learn wisdom from an old
adage not to recommend medicine to any one. I am so glad I did not
write of old Dr. Hiller's alacrity in getting over to Los Angeles when
he heard of this cure from Joe. She ought to have seen the old man
dance about my room, with greater alacrity! 500 dollars was too much
for the old man; he is a German; he dances about, slaps his pockets and
says, ""You can'th have goth the five hundred, buth for this silly
cure!"" </p>
<p>Then there are poor people who paid her three<!--'Volume 8 Page 511'-->
dollars a rubbing sometimes and now complimenting Joe and myself. Don't
tell this to Joe. You and she can afford to lose money on anyone. So
also the old German doctor, but the poor boy finds it a bit hard. The
old doctor is now persuaded that some <i>devils</i> are
misarranging his affairs of late. He had counted on so much to have me
as his guest, and his wife righted, but he had to run to Los Angeles
and that upset the whole plan; and now, though he tries his best to get
me in as his guest, I fight shy, not of him, but of his wife and
sister-in-law. He is sure, ""Devils must be in it""; he has been a
Theosophical student. I told him to write to Miss MacLeod to hunt up a
devil-driver somewhere so that he might run with his wife and spend
another five hundred! Doing good is not always smooth! </p>
<p>As for me, I get the fun out of it &#8212; as long as Joe pays &#8212;
bone-cracker, or skin-parer, or any system whatever. But this was not
fair of Joe &#8212; after having got in all these people to get rubbed down,
to run off and let me bear all the compliments! I am glad she is not
introducing any outsiders to be skinned. Otherwise Joe would be gone to
Paris, leaving poor Mr. Leggett to collect the compliments. I sent in a
Christian Science healer to Dr. Hiller as a make-up of Joe's
misdemeanour, but his wife slammed the door in her face and would have
nothing to do with queer healing. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I sincerely hope and pray Mrs. Leggett will be well
this time. Did they analyse the sting? </p>
<p>I hope the will will arrive soon; I am a bit anxious about it.
I expected to get a draft trust-deed also by this mail from India; no
letters came, not even <i>Awakened India</i>, though I
find <i>Awakened India</i> has reached San Francisco. </p>
<p>I read in the papers the other day of 500 deaths in one week
of plague in Calcutta! Mother knows what is good. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 512'-->
<p>So Mr. Leggett has got the V. Society up. Good. </p>
<p>How is Olea? Where is Margot? I wrote her a letter the other
day to 21 W. 34, N.Y. I am so happy that she is making headway. With
all love,</p>

<p>Here is a long letter from A__. He seems to be entirely upset.
I am sure a little kindness will completely win him over. He thinks
that you want to drive<!--'Volume 8 Page 514'--> him out

<p>I think, as things stand in New York, they require my

<p>I have been making enough money to pay my passage. I will stop

<p>Of course by that time you will be off. A__ has done good work

<p>The man who can work has an individuality of his own and

what to do. </p>
<p>The remittance to Calcutta has duly reached. I got news of it
by this mail. My cousin sends her respects and thanks, but she is sorry
she cannot write English. </p>
<p>I am getting better every day, and even walking uphill. There
are falls now and then, but the duration is decreasing constantly. My
thanks to Mrs. Milton. </p>
<p>I had a little note from Siri Gryanander. Poor girl, she is so
thankful to be trusted. That is just like Mrs. Leggett &#8212; good, good,
good. Money is not evil after all &#8212; in good hands. I hope fervently
Siri will completely recover, poor child. </p>

<p>I have finished my work here; only, out of San Francisco,

<p>MY DEAR JOE, </p>
<p>Received your note today. I wrote you one yesterday but
directed it to England thinking you will be there. </p>
<p>I have given your message to Mrs. Betts. I am so sorry this
little quarrel came with A__. I got also his letter you sent. He is
correct so far as he says, ""Swami wrote me 'Mr. Leggett is not
interested in Vedanta and will not help any more. You stand on your own
feet.'"" It was as you and Mrs. Leggett desired me to write him from Los
Angeles about New York &#8212; in reply to his asking me what to do for
funds. </p>
<p>Well, things will take their own shape, but it seems in Mrs.
Bull's and your mind there is some idea that I ought to do something.

MY DEAR JOE,

Received your note today. I wrote you one yesterday but directed it to England thinking you will be there.

I have given your message to Mrs. Betts. I am so sorry this little quarrel came with A__. I got also his letter you sent. He is correct so far as he says, ""Swami wrote me 'Mr. Leggett is not interested in Vedanta and will not help any more. You stand on your own feet.'"" It was as you and Mrs. Leggett desired me to write him from Los Angeles about New York — in reply to his asking me what to do for funds.

Well, things will take their own shape, but it seems in Mrs. Bull's and your mind there is some idea that I ought to do something. But in the first place I do not know anything about the difficulties. None of you write me anything about what that is for, and I am no thought-reader. You simply wrote me a general idea that A__ wanted to keep things in his hands. What can I understand from it? What are the difficulties? Regarding what the differences are about, I am as much in the dark as about the exact date of the Day of Destruction! And yet Mrs. Bull's and your letters show quite an amount of vexation! These things get complicated sometimes, in spite of ourselves. Let them take their shape.

I have executed and sent the will to Mr. Leggett as desired by Mrs. Bull.

I am going on, sometimes well and at other times ill. I cannot say, on my conscience, that I have been theleast benefited by Mrs. Milton. She has been good to me, I am very thankful. My love to her. Hope she will benefit others.

For writing to Mrs. Bull this fact, I got a four page sermon, as to how I ought to be grateful and thankful, etc., etc. All that is, sure, the outcome of this A__ business!

<p class=""right"">1921 W. 21 STREET, <br>
LOS ANGELES, <br>
<i>17th June, 1900</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MARY, </p>
<p>It is true I am much better, but not yet completely recovered;
anyway, the complexion of the mind is one belonging to everyone that
suffers. It is neither gas nor anything else. </p>
<p>Kâli worship is not a necessary step in any religion. The
Upanishads teach us all there is of religion. Kali worship is my
special <i>fad</i>; you never heard me preach<!--'Volume 8 Page 523'-->
it, or read of my preaching it in India. I only preach what is good for
universal humanity. If there is any curious method which applies
entirely to me, I keep it a secret and there it ends. I must not
explain to you what Kali worship is, as I never taught it to anybody. </p>
<p>You are entirely mistaken if you think the Boses are rejected
by the Hindu people. The English rulers want to push him into a corner.
They don't of course like that sort of development in the Indian race.
They make it hot for him, that is why he seeks to go elsewhere. </p>
<p>By the ""anglicised"" are meant people who by their manners and
conduct show that they are ashamed of us poor, old type Hindus. I am
not ashamed of my race or my birth or nationality. That such people are
not liked by the Hindus, I cannot wonder. </p>
<p>Ceremonials and symbols etc. have no place in our religion
which is the doctrine of the Upanishads, pure and simple. Many people
think the ceremonial etc. help them in realising religion. I have no
objection. </p>
<p>Religion is that which does not depend upon books or teachers
or prophets or saviours, and that which does not make us dependent in
this or in any other lives upon others. In this sense Advaitism of the
Upanishads is the only religion. But saviours, books, prophets,
ceremonials, etc. have their places. They may help many as Kali worship
helps me in my <i>secular work</i>. They are welcome. </p>
<p>The Guru, however, is a different idea. It is the relation
between the transmitter and the receiver of force &#8212; psychic power and
knowledge. Each nation is a type, physically and mentally. Each is
constantly receiving ideas from others only to work them out <i>into</i>
its type, that is, along the national line. The time has not come for
the destruction of types. All education from any source is compatible
with the ideals in every country; only they<!--'Volume 8 Page 524'-->
must be nationalised, i.e. fall in line with the rest of the type
manifestation. </p>
<p>Renunciation is always the ideal of every race; only other
races do not know what they are made to do by nature unconsciously.
Through the ages one purpose runs sure. And that will be finished with
the destruction of this earth and the sun! And worlds are always in
progress indeed! And nobody as yet developed enough in any one of the
infinite worlds to communicate with us! Bosh! They are born, show the
same phenomena, and die the same death! Increasing purpose! Babies!
Live in the land of dreams, you babies! </p>
<p>Well, now about me. You must persuade Harriet to give me a few
dollars every month, and I will have some other friends do the same. If
I succeed, I fly off to India. I am dead tired of the platform work for
a living. It does not please me any more. I retire and do some writing
if I can do some scholarly work. </p>
<p>I am coming soon to Chicago, hope to be there in a few days.
Say, would not Mrs. Adams be able to get up a class for me to pay my
passage back? </p>
<p>Of course I shall try different places. So much of optimism
has come to me, Mary, that I should fly off to the Himalayas if I had
wings. </p>
<p>I have worked for this world, Mary, all my life, and it does
not give me a piece of bread without taking a pound of flesh. </p>
<p>If I can get a piece of bread a day, I retire entirely; but
this is impossible &#8212; this is the increasing purpose that is unfolding
all the devilish inwardness, as I am getting older! </p>
<p class=""right"">Ever yours in the Lord, </p>
<p class=""right"">VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 525'-->
<p>PS. If ever a man found the vanity of things, I have it now.
This is the world, hideous, beastly corpse. Who thinks of helping it is
a fool! But we have to work out our slavery by doing good or evil; I
have worked it out, I hope. May the Lord take me to the other shore!
Amen! I have given up all thoughts about India or any land. I am now
selfish, want to save myself! </p>

Each is constantly receiving ideas from others only to work them outintoits type, that is, along the national line. The time has not come for the destruction of types. All education from any source is compatible with the ideals in every country; only theymust be nationalised, i.e. fall in line with the rest of the type manifestation.

Renunciation is always the ideal of every race; only other races do not know what they are made to do by nature unconsciously. Through the ages one purpose runs sure. And that will be finished with the destruction of this earth and the sun! And worlds are always in progress indeed! And nobody as yet developed enough in any one of the infinite worlds to communicate with us! Bosh! They are born, show the same phenomena, and die the same death! Increasing purpose! Babies! Live in the land of dreams, you babies!

Well, now about me. You must persuade Harriet to give me a few dollars every month, and I will have some other friends do the same. If I succeed, I fly off to India. I am dead tired of the platform work for a living. It does not please me any more. I retire and do some writing if I can do some scholarly work.

I am coming soon to Chicago, hope to be there in a few days. Say, would not Mrs. Adams be able to get up a class for me to pay my passage back?

Of course I shall try different places. So much of optimism has come to me, Mary, that I should fly off to the Himalayas if I had wings.

I have worked for this world, Mary, all my life, and it does not give me a piece of bread without taking a pound of flesh.

If I can get a piece of bread a day, I retire entirely; but this is impossible — this is the increasing purpose that is unfolding all the devilish inwardness, as I am getting older!

PS. If ever a man found the vanity of things, I have it now. This is the world, hideous, beastly corpse. Who thinks of helping it is a fool! But we have to work out our slavery by doing good or evil; I have worked it out, I hope. May the Lord take me to the other shore! Amen! I have given up all thoughts about India or any land. I am now selfish, want to save myself!

DEAR __,

I had a letter from you several days ago, but I could not reply earlier. Mr. Sevier speaks well of you in his letter. I am very pleased at this.

Write to me in minute detail who all are there, and what each one is doing. Why don't you write letters to your mother? What is this? Devotion to the mother is the root of all welfare. How is your brother getting on with his studies at Calcutta? The Sannyasin-names of those there escape my memory — how to address each? Give my love to all conjointly.

<p>I have no longer any desire to kill myself by touring. For the

conversation well. If one can master this language and German
sufficiently, one can virtually become well acquainted with European
learning. The people of France are mere intellectualists, they run
after worldly things and firmly believe God and souls to be
superstitious; they are extremely loath to talk on such subjects. This
is a truly materialistic country! Let me see what that Lord does. But
this country is at the head of
Western culture, and Paris is the capital of that culture. </p>
<p>Brother, free me from all work connected with preaching. I am

<p>Many days ago I received a letter from Kali. He must have

longer trying to me. </p>
<p>There is a beautiful public park round the house. The

<p>God bless you at each step, my dear Christine, such is my
constant prayer! </p>
<p>Your letter, so beautiful and so calm, has given me that fresh
energy which I am often losing. </p>
<p>I am happy, yes, I am happy, but the cloud has not left me
entirely. It sometimes comes back, unfortunately, but it no longer has
the morbidity it used to have. </p>
<p>I am staying with a famous French writer, M. Jules Bois. I am
his guest. As he is a man making his living with his pen, he is not
rich; but we have many great ideas in common and feel happy together. </p>
<p>He discovered me a few years ago and has already translated
some of my pamphlets into French. We shall in the end find what we are
looking for, isn't it? </p>
<p>Thus, I shall travel with Madame Calve, Miss MacLeod, and M.
Jules Bois. I shall be the guest of Madame Calve, the famous singer. We
shall go to Constantinople, the Near East, Greece, and Egypt. On our
way back, we shall visit Venice. </p>
<p>It may be that I shall give a few lectures in Paris after my
return, but they will be in English with an interpreter. I have no time
any more, nor the power to study a new language at my age. I am an old
man, isn't it? </p>
<p>Mrs. Funke is ill. I think she works too hard. She already had
some nervous trouble. I hope she will soon be well. </p>
<!--'Volume 8 Page 538'-->
<p>I am sending all the money I earned in America to India. Now I
am free, the begging-monk as before. I have also resigned from the
Presidentship of the Monastery. Thank God, I am free! It is no more for
me to carry such a responsibility. I am so nervous and so weak. </p>
<p>""As the birds which have slept in the branches of a tree wake
up, singing when the dawn comes, and soar up into the deep blue sky, so
is the end of my life."" </p>
<p>I have had many difficulties, and also some very great
successes. But all my difficulties and suffering count for nothing, as
I have succeeded. I have attained my aim. I have found the pearl for
which I dived into the ocean of life. I have been rewarded. I am
pleased. </p>
<p>Thus it seems to me that a new chapter of my life is opening.
It seems to me that Mother will now lead me slowly and softly. No more
effort on roads full of obstacles, now it is the bed prepared with
birds' down. Do you understand that? Believe me, I feel quite sure. </p>
<p>The experience of all my life, up to now, has taught me, thank
God, that I always find what I am looking for with eagerness. Sometimes
it is after much suffering, but it does not matter! All is forgotten in
the softness of the reward. You are also going through troubles, my

a reward but an additional affliction. </p>

<p>I have received your book. In Hrishikesh, Kali [Swami
Abhedananda] has had a relapse and is again suffering from what seems
to be malaria. Once it comes, the fever does not easily leave those who
have never had it before. I too suffered the same way when I first had
the attack of fever. Kali has never had the fever before. I have not
received any letter from Hrishikesh. Where is . . . ?</p>
<p>I am suffering terribly from a backache which began in
Allahabad. I had recovered from it some time back, but it has recurred.

RESPECTED SIR

I have received your book. In Hrishikesh, Kali [Swami Abhedananda] has had a relapse and is again suffering from what seems to be malaria. Once it comes, the fever does not easily leave those who have never had it before. I too suffered the same way when I first had the attack of fever. Kali has never had the fever before. I have not received any letter from Hrishikesh. Where is . . . ?

I am suffering terribly from a backache which began in Allahabad. I had recovered from it some time back, but it has recurred. So I will have to stay here awhile longer because of my back and also because Babaji [Pavhari Baba] has requested it.

President of the late World's Fair. I am thoroughly disgusted with this

by joining this man. Hope you are all well. Mrs. Bagley and her
daughters are very kind to me. I hope to do some private lecturing here
and then go to Ada and then back to Chicago. It is snowing here this
morning. They are very nice people here, and the different clubs took a
good deal of interest in me.</p>
<p>It is rather wearisome, these constant receptions and dinners;
and
their horrible dinners &#8212; a hundred dinners concentrated into one &#8212; and
when in a man's club, why, smoking on between the courses and then
beginning afresh. I thought the Chinese alone make a dinner run through
half a day with intervals of smoking!!</p>
<p>However, they are very gentlemanly men and, strange to say, an
Episcopal clergyman<a name=""t3""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn3"">3</a>
and a Jewish rabbi<a name=""t4""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn4"">4</a>
take great interest in me and eulogize me. Now the man who got up the
lectures here got at least a thousand dollars. So in every place. And
this is Slayton's duty to do for me. Instead, he, the liar, had told me
often that he has agents everywhere and would advertise and do all that
for me. And this is what he is doing. His will be done. I am going
home. Seeing the liking the American people have for me, I could have,
by this time, got a pretty large sum. But Jimmy Mills<a name=""t5""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn5"">5</a>
and Slayton were sent by the Lord to stand in the way. His ways are
inscrutable.</p>
<p>However,
this is a secret. President Palmer has gone to Chicago to try to get me
loose from this liar of a Slayton. Pray that he may succeed. Several
judges here have seen my contract, and they say it is a shameful fraud
and can be broken any moment; but I am a monk &#8212; no self-defence.

that Mr. Palmer is a very hearty, jolly, good old man and very rich. He
has been uniformly kind to me. Tomorrow I go back to Mrs. Bagley's

<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>I am in New York. The gentleman [Dr. Guernsey] whose guest I
am is a very nice and learned and well-to-do man. He had an only son
whom he lost last July. Has only a daughter now. The old couple have
received a great shock, but they are pure and God-loving people and
bear it manfully. The lady of the house is very, very kind and good.
They are trying to help me as much as they can and they will do a good
deal, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>Awaiting further developments. This Thursday [April 5] they
will invite a number of the brainy people of the Union League Club and
other places of which the Doctor is a member, and see what comes out of
it. Parlour lectures are a great feature in this city, and more can be
made by each such lecture than even platform talks in other cities.</p>
<p>It is a very clean city. None of that black smoke tarring
everyone in five minutes; and the street in which the Doctor lives is a
nice, quiet one.</p>
<p>Hope the sisters are doing well and enjoying their music, both
in the opera and the parlour. I am sure I would have appreciated the
music at the opera about which Miss Mary wrote to me. I am sure the
opera musicians do not show the interior anatomy of their throats and
lungs.</p>

<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>I just now received your letter. I have the greatest regard
for the Salvationists; in fact, they and the Oxford Mission gentlemen
are the only Christian missionaries for whom I have any regard at all.
They live with the people, as the people, and for the people of India.
Lord bless them. But I would be very, very sorry of any trick being
played by them. I never have heard of any <i>Lord</i> in
India, much less in <i>Ceylon</i>. (Now Sri Lanka.) The
people of Ceylon and northern India differ more than Americans and
Hindus. Nor is there any connection between the Buddhist priest and the
Hindu. Our dress, manners, religion, food, language differ entirely
from southern India, much less to speak of Ceylon. You know already
that I could not speak a word of Narasimha's language!!<!--'Volume 9 Page 18'-->
Although that was only <i>Madras</i>. Well, you
have Hindu princesses; why not a Lord, which is not a higher title.</p>
<p>There was a certain Mrs. Smith in Chicago.<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
I met her at Mrs. Stockham's. She has introduced me to the Guernseys.
Dr. Guernsey is one of the chief physicians of this city and is a very
good old gentleman. They are very fond of me and are very nice people.
Next Friday I am going to Boston. I have not been lecturing in New York
at all. I will come back and do some lecturing here.</p>
<p>For the last few days I was the guest of Miss Helen Gould &#8212;
daughter of the rich Gould<a name=""t2""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
&#8212; at her palatial country residence, an hour's ride from the city. She
has one of the most beautiful and large green-houses in the world, full
of all sorts of curious plants and flowers. They are Presbyterians, and
she is a very religious lady. I had a very nice time there.</p>
<p>I met my friend Mr. Flagg (William Joseph Flagg.) several
times. He is flying merrily. There is another Mrs. Smith here who is
very rich and pious. She has invited me to dine today.</p>
<p>As for lecturing, I have given up raising money. I cannot
degenerate myself any more. When a certain purpose was in view, I could
work; with that gone I cannot earn for myself. I have sufficient for
going back. I have not tried to earn a penny here, and have refused
some presents which friends here wanted to make to me. Especially Flagg
&#8212; I have refused his money. I had in Detroit tried to refund the money
back to the donors, and told them that, there being almost no chance of
my succeeding in my enterprise, I had no right to keep their money; but
they refused and told me to throw that into the waters if I liked. But
I cannot take any more conscientiously. I am very well off, Mother.
Everywhere the Lord sends me kind persons and homes; so there is no use
of my going into beastly worldliness at all.</p>
<!--'Volume 9 Page 19'-->
<p>The New York people, though not so intellectual as the
Bostonians, are, I think, more sincere. The Bostonians know well how to
take adv<a href=""#t1"">a</a>ntage of everybody. And I
am afraid even water cannot slip
through their closed fin<a href=""t1"">gers!!! Lord bless
them!!! I have promised to
go and I must go; but, Lord, make me live with</a> the sincere,
ignorant
and the poor, and not cross the shadow of the hypocrites and tall
talkers who, as my Master used to say, are like vultures who soar high
and high in their talks, but the heart is really on a piece of carrion
on the ground.</p>
<p>I would be the guest of Mrs. Breed for a few days and, after
seeing a little of Boston, I would come back to New York.</p>
<p>Hope the sisters are all right and enjoying their concerts
immensely. There is not much of music in this city. That is a blessing
(?) Went to see Barnum's circus the other day. It is no doubt a grand
thing. I have not been as yet downtown. This street is very nice and
quiet.</p>
<p>I heard a beautiful piece of music the other day at Barnum's &#8212;
they call it a Spanish Serenada. Whatever it be, I liked it so much.
Unfortunately, Miss Guernsey is not given to much thumping, although
she has a good assortment of all the noisy stuffs in the world &#8212; and so
she could not play it, which I regret ever so much.</p>

<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>Hope you are settled down in peace by this time. The babies
are doing well in Mudville (Kenosha, Wisconsin) &#8212; in their nunnery, I
am sure. It is very hot here, but now and then a breeze comes up which
cools it down. I am now with Miss [Mary A.] Phillips. Will move off
from here on Tuesday to another place.</p>
<p>Here I find a quotation from a speech by Sir Monier Williams,
professor of Sanskrit in the Oxford University. It is very strange as
coming from one who every day expects to see the whole of India

rapidly increasing. And far more remarkable than this is that, it is

one religion<!--'Volume 9 Page 25'--> of humanity, of

adaptability to the infinite diversity of human characters and human
tendencies. It has its highly spiritual and abstract side suited to the
philosophical higher classes. Its practical and concrete side suited to
the man of affairs and the man of the world. Its aesthetic and

DEAR MOTHER,

Hope you are settled down in peace by this time. The babies are doing well in Mudville (Kenosha, Wisconsin) — in their nunnery, I am sure. It is very hot here, but now and then a breeze comes up which cools it down. I am now with Miss [Mary A.] Phillips. Will move off from here on Tuesday to another place.

Here I find a quotation from a speech by Sir Monier Williams, professor of Sanskrit in the Oxford University. It is very strange as coming from one who every day expects to see the whole of India converted to Christianity. ""And yet it is a remarkable characteristic of Hinduism that it neither requires nor attempts to make converts. Nor is it at present by any means decreasing in numbers, nor is it being driven out of the field by two such proselytizing religions as Mahomedanism [sic] and Christianity.

CEDAR LAWN, FISHKILL ON THE HUDSON</p>
<p class=""right""><i>19 July 1894</i></p>
<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>Your kind note reached me here yesterday evening. I am so glad
to hear the babies are enjoying. I got the <i>Interior</i>
and am<!--'Volume 9 Page 26'--> very glad to see my friend
Mazoomdar&#8217;s (Pratap Chandra Mazumdar.) book spoken of so highly.
Mazoomdar is a great and a good man and has done much for his fellow
beings.</p>
<p>It is a lovely summer place, this Cedar Lawn of the Guernseys.
Miss Guernsey has gone on a visit to Swampscott. I had also an
invitation there, but I thought [it] better to stay here in the calm
and silent place full of trees and with the beautiful Hudson flowing by
and mountain in the background.</p>
<p>I am very thankful for Miss Howe&#8217;s suggestion, and I am also
thinking of it. Most probably I will go to England very soon. But
between you and me, I am a sort of mystic and cannot move without <i>orders</i>,
and that has not come yet. Mr. [Charles M.] Higgins, a rich young
lawyer and inventor of Brooklyn, is arranging some lectures for me. I
have not settled whether I will stop for them or not.</p>
<p>My eternal thanks to you for your kindness. My whole life
cannot repay my debt to you. (Original letter: your debt.) You may see
from the letter from Madras that there is not a word about Narasimha.
What can I do more? I did not get the cheque cashed yet, for there was
no necessity. Miss Phillips was very kind to me. She is an old lady,
about 50 or more. You need not feel any worry about my being taken care
of. The Lord always takes care of His servants; and so long as I am
really His servant and not the world&#8217;s, I am very confident of getting
everything that would be good for me. The Guernseys love me very much,
and there are many families in New York and Brooklyn who would take the
best care of me.</p>
<p>I had a beautiful letter from Mr. Snell,<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
saying that a sudden change for the better has taken place in his
fortunes and offering me thrice the money I lent him as a contribution
to my work. And he also has beautiful letters from Dharmapala and
others from India. But, of course, I politely refused his repayment.</p>
<p>So far so good. I have seen Mr. [Walter Hines] Page, the
editor of the <i>Forum</i> here. He was so sorry not to
get the article<!--'Volume 9 Page 27'--> on missionaries.
But I have promised to write on other interesting subjects. Hope I will
have patience to do so. </p>
<p>I had a letter yesterday from Miss Harriet, (Mrs. Hale&#8217;s
daughter.) from which I learn that they are enjoying Kenosha (A port in
Southeast Wisconsin, on Lake Michigan.) very much. Lord bless you and
yours, Mother Church, for ever and ever. I cannot even express my
gratitude to you.</p>
<p>As for me, you need not be troubled in the least. My whole
life is that of a <i>vagabond</i> &#8212; homeless, roving
tramp; any fare, good or bad, in any country, is good enough for me.</p>

<p>DEAR MOTHER</p>
<p>I have received the letter you sent over to me coming from
India.</p>
<p>I am going to leave this place on Monday next for Plymouth
[Massachusetts], where the Free Religious Association<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
is holding its session. They will defray my expenses, of course.</p>
<!--'Volume 9 Page 30'-->
<p>I am all right, enjoying nice health, and the people here are
very kind and nice to me. Up to date I had no occasion to cash any
cheque as everything is going on smoothly. I have not heard anything
from the Babies. Hope they are doing well. You also had nothing to
write; however, I feel that you are doing well.</p>
<p>I would have gone over to another place, but Mr. Higginson's<a name=""t2""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
invitation ought to be attended
to. And Plymouth is the place where the
fathers of your country first landed. I want, therefore, to see it.</p>
<p>I am all right. It is useless reiterating my love and
gratitude to you and yours &#8212; you know it all. May the Lord shower His
choicest blessings on you and yours.</p>
<p>This meeting is composed of the best professors of your
country and other people, so I must attend it; and then they would pay
me. I have not yet determined all my plans, only I am going to lecture
in New York this coming fall; every arrangement is complete for that.
They have printed advertisements at their own expense for that and made
everything ready.</p>
<p>Give my best love to the Babies, to Father Pope, and believe
me ever in gratitude and love,</p>
<p class=""right"">Your Son,</p>
<p class=""right"">
VIVEKANANDA.</p>
<p>P.S. I am very much obliged to the sisters for asking me to
tell them if I want anything. I have no want anyway &#8212; I have everything
I require and more to spare.</p>

DEAR MOTHER

I have received the letter you sent over to me coming from India.

I am going to leave this place on Monday next for Plymouth [Massachusetts], where the Free Religious Association1is holding its session. They will defray my expenses, of course.

I am all right, enjoying nice health, and the people here are very kind and nice to me. Up to date I had no occasion to cash any cheque as everything is going on smoothly. I have not heard anything from the Babies. Hope they are doing well. You also had nothing to write; however, I feel that you are doing well.

I would have gone over to another place, but Mr. Higginson's2invitation ought to be attended to. And Plymouth is the place where the fathers of your country first landed. I want, therefore, to see it.

I am all right. It is useless reiterating my love and gratitude to you and yours — you know it all. May the Lord shower His choicest blessings on you and yours.

This meeting is composed of the best professors of your country and other people, so I must attend it; and then they would pay me. I have not yet determined all my plans, only I am going to lecture in New York this coming fall; every arrangement is complete for that. They have printed advertisements at their own expense for that and made everything ready.

Give my best love to the Babies, to Father Pope, and believe me ever in gratitude and love,

P.S. I am very much obliged to the sisters for asking me to tell them if I want anything. I have no want anyway — I have everything I require and more to spare.

""He never gives up His servants.""

My thanks and gratitude eternal to the sisters for their kindness in asking about my wants.",V.,,316,1,0

<p>Your letters just now reached me. I had some beautiful letters
from India. The letter from Ajit Singh (The Raja of Khetri, a very
devoted disciple of the Swami.) shows that the phonograph has not
reached yet, and it was dated 8th June. So I do not think it is time
yet to get an answer. I am not astonished at my friends' asking Cook

<p>I have a letter from Madras which says they will soon send
money to Narasimha (Narasimhacharya. <i>Vide</i> the
letter dated <a href=""009_mother.htm"">February 14, 1894</a>.)
&#8212; in fact, as soon as they get a reply to their letter written to
Narasimha. So kindly let Narasimha know it. The photographs have not
reached me &#8212; except two of Fishkill when I was there last. Landsberg
(Leon Landsberg. <i>Vide</i> the letter dated <a href=""022_mother.htm"">June 28, 1894</a>.) has kindly
sent over the letters. From here I will probably go over to Fishkill.

<p>I have beautiful letters from the sisters.</p>
<p>By the by, your missionaries try to make me a malcontent

<p>DEAR MOTHER</p>
<p>The photographs reached safely yesterday. I cannot tell
exactly whether Harrison ought to give me more or not. They had sent
only two to me at Fishkill<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
&#8212; not the pose I ordered, though.</p>
<p>Narasimha has perhaps got his passage by this time. He will
get it soon, whether his family gives him the money or not. I have
written to my friends in Madras to look to it, and they write me they
will.</p>
<p>I would be very glad if he becomes a Christian or Mohammedan
or any religion that suits him; but I am afraid for some time to come
none will suit our friend. Only if he becomes a Christian he will have
a chance to marry again, even in India &#8212; the Christians there
permitting it. I am so sorry to learn that it is the ""bondage of
heathen India"" that, after all, was the cause of all this mischief. We
learn as we live. So we were all this time ignorantly and blindly
blaming our much suffering, persecuted,<!--'Volume 9 Page 33'-->
saintly friend Narasimha, while all the fault was really owing to the
""bondage of heathen India""!!!!</p>
<p>But to give the devil his due, this heathen India has been
supplying him with money to go on a spree again and again. And this
time too ""heathen India"" will [take] or already has taken our
""enlightened"" and persecuted friend from out of his present scrape, and
not ""Christian America""!! Mrs. Smith's plan is not bad after all &#8212; to
turn Narasimha into a missionary of Christ. But unfortunately for the
world, many and many a time the flag of Christ has been entrusted to
such hands. But I would beg to add that he will then be only a
missionary of Smithian American Christianity, not Christ's. Arrant
humbug! That thing to preach Lord Jesus!!! Is He in want of men to
uphold His banner? Pooh! the very idea is revolting. Do good to India
indeed! Thank your charity and call back your dog &#8212; as the tramp said.
Keep such good workers for America. The Hindus will have a quarantine
against all such [outcasting] to protect their society. I heartily
advise Narasimha to become a <i>Christian</i> &#8212; I beg your
pardon, a convert to <i>Americanism</i> &#8212; because I am
sure such a jewel is unsaleable in poor India. He is welcome to
anything that will fetch a price. I know the gentleman whom you name
perfectly well, and you may give him any information about me you like.
I do not care for sending scraps<a name=""t2""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
and getting a boom for me. And these friends from India bother me
enough for newspaper nonsense. They are very devoted, faithful and holy
friends. I have not much of these scraps now. After a long search I
found a bit in a <i>Boston Transcript</i>. I send it over
to you.<a name=""t3""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn3"">3</a>
This public life is such a botheration. I am nearly daft.</p>
<!--'Volume 9 Page 34'-->
<p>Where to fly? In India I have become horribly public &#8212; crowds
will follow me and take my life out. I got an Indian letter from
Landsberg. Every ounce of fame can only be bought at the cost of a
pound of peace and holiness. I never thought of that before. I have
become entirely disgusted with this blazoning. I am disgusted with
myself. Lord will show me the way to peace and purity. Why, Mother, I
confess to you: no man can live in an atmosphere of public life, even
in religion, without the devil of competition now and then thrusting
his head into the serenity of his heart. Those who are trained to
preach a <i>doctrine</i> never feel it, for they never
knew <i>religion</i>. But those that are after <i>God</i>,
and not after the world, feel at once that every bit of name and fame
is at the cost of their purity. It is so much gone from that ideal of
perfect <i>unselfishness</i>, perfect disregard of gain or
name or fame. Lord help me. Pray for me, Mother. I am very much
disgusted with myself. Oh, why the world be so that one cannot do
anything without putting himself to the front; why cannot one act
hidden and unseen and unnoticed? The world has not gone one step beyond
idolatry yet. They cannot act from ideas, they cannot be led by ideas.
But they want the person, the man. And<!--'Volume 9 Page 35'-->
any man that wants to do something must pay the penalty &#8212; no hope. This
nonsense of the world. Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.</p>
<p>By the by, I have got such a beautiful edition of Thomas à

""behind the veil"" &#8212; few ever got such. My, that is religion. No humbug
of the world. No shilly-shallying, tall talk, conjecture &#8212; I presume, I
believe, I think. How I would like to go out of this piece of painted
humbug they call the beautiful world with Thomas à Kempis &#8212; beyond,
beyond, which can only be felt, never expressed.</p>
<p>That is religion. Mother, there is God. There all the saints,
prophets and incarnations meet. Beyond the Babel of Bibles and Vedas,
creeds and crafts, dupes and doctrines &#8212; where is all light, all love,
where the miasma of this earth can never reach. Ah! who will take me
thither? Do you sympathize with me, Mother? My soul is groaning now
under the hundred sorts of bondage I am placing on it. Whose India? Who
cares? Everything is His. What are we? Is He dead? Is He sleeping? He,
without whose command a leaf does not fall, a heart does not beat, who
is nearer to me than my own self. It is bosh and nonsense &#8212; to do good
or do bad or do fuzz. We do nothing. We are not. The world is not. He
is, He is. Only He is. None else is. He is.</p>

(From the Indian Mirror, July 14, 1894): ""There has been some lively
correspondence between Swami Vivekananda and a retired Christian
Missionary on the work and prospects of Christianity in India. Among
other things, the Swami is reported to have said that 'the way of
converting is absolutely absurd'; 'Missionary doctors do no good,
because they are not in touch with the people.' 'They accomplish
nothing in the way of converting, although they may have nice sociable
times among themselves, etc.' The revered gentleman took exception to
the words, maintaining that, speaking the vernaculars well, nobody of
foreigners understands and sympathises with Indians better than
Missionaries. The Missionaries are undoubtedly good and well-meaning
people; but we think the statement of the Swami that they are seldom in
touch with the people is not without foundation. With the revival of
Hinduism, manifested in every part of the country, it is doubtful
whether Christianity will have any sway over the Hindus. The present is
a critical time for Christian Missions in India. The Swami thanked the
Missionary for calling him his fellow-countryman. 'This is the first
time,' he wrote, 'any European foreigner, born in India though he may
be, has dared to call a detested Native by that name &#8212; Missionary or no
Missionary. Would you dare to call me the same in India?' Would he,
indeed?"". &nbsp; (From the Amrita Bazar Patrika, August 24, 1894):
""The insinuation that Swami Vivekananda is not an 'orthodox' Hindu owes
its origin to missionary influence. It is simply impossible for the
missionaries to love Vivekananda, and it is therefore natural that they
should try to bring him down. And why is Vivekananda not an orthodox
Hindu? It is because, say they, he has crossed the ocean and eaten
un-Hindu food. But the restriction which Hinduism imposes on its
members has no forces upon the liberated &#8212; the Sannyasis, to which
class the Swami belongs. The Hindu who has cut off his connection with
the world has liberty to take anything and to go anywhere he pleases.
Vivekananda deserves well of the world. The world is now governed by
the West. In the West, especially in America, every man is a monarch.
To make any impression in such a country is beyond the means of the
ablest of our species. Vivekananda's work in America is a miracle, and
he is no doubt an instrument in the hands of God.""</li>

DATE DO NOT KNOW<br>
[<i>Postmarked: August 28, 1894</i>]</p>
<p>DEAR MOTHER</p>
<p>I have been for three days at Magnolia. Magnolia is one of the
most fashionable and beautiful seaside resorts of this part. I<!--'Volume 9 Page 36'-->
think the scenery is better than that of Annisquam. The rocks there are
very beautiful, and the forests run down to the very edge of the water.
There is a very beautiful pine forest. A lady of Chicago and her
daughter, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Sawyer, were the friends that invited me
up there. They had also arranged a lecture for me, out of which I got
$43. I met a good many Boston people &#8212; Mrs. Smith Junior, who said she
knows Harriet, and Mrs. Smith the elder, [who] knows you well.</p>
<p>In Boston the other day I met a Unitarian clergyman who said
he lives next to you in Chicago. I have unfortunately forgotten his
name. Mrs. Smith is a very nice lady and treated me with all courtesy.
Mrs. Bagley is kind as ever, and I will have to remain here a few days
more, I am afraid. Prof. Wright and I are having a good time. Prof.
Bradley of Evanston<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
has gone home. If you ever meet him at Evanston, give him my best love
and regards. He is really a spiritual man.</p>
<p>I do not find anything more to write.</p>
<p>Some unknown friend has sent me from New York a fountain pen.
So I am writing with it to test it. It is working very smoothly and
nicely as you can judge from the writing. Perhaps Narasimha's
difficulties have been settled by this time, and ""heathen India"" has
helped him out yet, I hope.</p>
<p>What is Father Pope doing? What the Babies are doing and where
are they? What news of our Sam?<a name=""t2""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>
Hope he is prospering. Kindly give him my best love. Where is Mother
Temple now?</p>
<p>Well, after all, I could fill up two pages. Yes, there was a

DEAR MOTHER

I have been for three days at Magnolia. Magnolia is one of the most fashionable and beautiful seaside resorts of this part. Ithink the scenery is better than that of Annisquam. The rocks there are very beautiful, and the forests run down to the very edge of the water. There is a very beautiful pine forest. A lady of Chicago and her daughter, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Sawyer, were the friends that invited me up there. They had also arranged a lecture for me, out of which I got $43. I met a good many Boston people — Mrs. Smith Junior, who said she knows Harriet, and Mrs. Smith the elder, [who] knows you well.

In Boston the other day I met a Unitarian clergyman who said he lives next to you in Chicago. I have unfortunately forgotten his name. Mrs. Smith is a very nice lady and treated me with all courtesy. Mrs. Bagley is kind as ever, and I will have to remain here a few days more, I am afraid. Prof. Wright and I are having a good time. Prof. Bradley of Evanston1has gone home. If you ever meet him at Evanston, give him my best love and regards. He is really a spiritual man.

I do not find anything more to write.

Some unknown friend has sent me from New York a fountain pen. So I am writing with it to test it. It is working very smoothly and nicely as you can judge from the writing. Perhaps Narasimha's difficulties have been settled by this time, and ""heathen India"" has helped him out yet, I hope.

What is Father Pope doing? What the Babies are doing and where are they? What news of our Sam?2Hope he is prospering. Kindly give him my best love. Where is Mother Temple now?

Well, after all, I could fill up two pages. Yes, there was a Miss Barn (?) who said she met me at your house. She is a young lady of Chicago.

Magnolia is a good bathing place and I had two baths in the sea. A large concourse of men and women go to bathe there every day — the most part men. And strange, women do not give up their coat of mail even while bathing. That is how these mailclad she-warriors of America have got the superiority over men.

Our Sanskrit poets lavish all the power of expression they have upon the soft body of women — the Sanskrit word forwomen is ""Komala"", the soft body; but the mailclad ones of this country are ""armadillas"", I think. You cannot imagine how ludicrous it appears to a foreigner who never saw it before. Shiva, Shiva.

Now Narasimha's Mrs. Smith does not torture you anymore with letters, I hope. Did I tell you I met your friend Mrs. H. O. Quarry at Swampscott? — she can swamp a house for all that, not to speak of a cott — and that I met there the woman that pulls by the nose Mr. Pullman?3And I also heard there the best American singer, (Miss Emma Thursby.) they said — she sang beautifully; she sang ""Bye Baby Bye"".

Send a good word, a good thought &#8212; at least to the down-trodden,

living with Mrs. Bull, there is no expense. She is a rich and highly
cultured lady. She has given me $500 for my work or anything I like. As
I am not going west very soon, I will have a bank account here in
Boston. From Philadelphia I go to Washington, and then I will run
between New York and Boston. So I do not think I will be able to see
you, except perhaps Sister Mary. I want so very much that Mary will see
Mrs. Bull and others of my friends here. I have the fat of the land as
usual, and my dinner is cooking very well both here and in India. Do
not make it public, Mother &#8212; that is between you and me and the babies
&#8212; and do not worry yourself about anything. All things come to him that
waits. I am going to send the greater part of the money I have got to
India and then money will come faster. I have always found that the
faster I spend, the faster it comes. Nature abhors a vacuum. I am in
very good spirits, only you must not stop keeping me informed about
yourself, Babies and Father Pope from time to time.</p>

I have been very late this time in writing you as Sister Mary1has already written to you, no doubt, about me.

The clothes have all reached safe, only I will send over some of the summer and other clothes as it will be impossible to carry the burden all along with me.

The certainty about going to Europe this December has gone; so I am uncertain when I go.

DEAR MISS THURSBY,

I am very sorry to learn about the passing on of Mr. Thorp.1Mrs. Bull must have felt it deeply. Still he has passed on after a good and useful life. All is for the best.

I have been lecturing every day to a class in Mrs. Adams's2rooms at the Auditorium. Today I also lecture there and in the Evening to a class of Miss Josephine Locke's3at the Plaza Hotel.

Have you seen Mrs. Peake4in New York? She is lecturing to a class at Mrs. Guernsey's.

Miss Locke is as kind as usual. She is enamoured of Mrs. Peake as are many of Miss Locke's friends, you will be glad to learn.

Mrs. Peake has made a very favourable impression on Chicago. So she does wherever she goes.

Mrs. Adams invited me to an organ concert in the Auditorium. She is so good and kind to me. Lord bless her.

I have not seen Mr. Young, nor, I am afraid, [will] I have time to see [him,] as I start for New York on Friday next.

I will hear him once in New York.

I was so busy here these two weeks.

I have got a new scarlet coat but can get no orange here.

Ever with blessings,","Your brother,

<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>I am sure you are all right by this time. The babies write
from time to time and so I get your news regularly. Miss Mary is in a
lecturing mood now &#8212; good for her. Hope she will not let her energies
fritter away now &#8212; a penny saved is a penny gained. Sister Isabel[le]
has sent me the French Books and the Calcutta pamphlets have arrived,
but the big Sanskrit books ought to come. I want them badly. Make them
payable here, if possible, or I will send you the postage.</p>
<p>I am doing very well. Only some of these big dinners kept me
late, and I returned home at 2 o'clock in the morning several days.
Tonight I am going to one of these. This will be the last of its kind.
So much keeping up the night is not good for me. Every day from 11 to 1
o'clock I have classes in my rooms and I talk [to] them till they
[grow] tired. The Brooklyn course ended yesterday. Another lecture I
have there next Monday.</p>
<p>Bean soup and rice or barley is now my general diet. I am
faring well. Financially I am making the ends meet and nothing more
because I do not charge anything for the classes I have in my rooms.
And the public lectures have to go through so many hands.</p>
<p>I have a good many lectures planned ahead in New York, which I
hope to deliver by and by. Sister Isabel wrote to me a<!--'Volume 9 Page 54'-->
beautiful letter and she does so much for me. My eternal gratitude to
her.</p>

interesting. Behind her parlor she has a long arbour with all sorts of

<p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>Perhaps you did not receive my letter asking you to send the
Calcutta pamphlets<!--'Volume 9 Page 57'--> about the
Paramahamsa Ramakrishna. Kindly send them to me at 54 W. 33, and also
the pamphlets about the Calcutta meeting if you have any. Also the
summer coat to the care of Miss Phillips, 19 W. 38.</p>
<p>As I do not see any probability of my going soon to Chicago, I
am thinking of drawing all my money from the Chicago bank to New York.
Will you kindly ascertain the exact total amount I have in Chicago so
that I may draw it out at once and deposit it in some New York bank?</p>
<p>Kindly do these and I will bother you no more. I have written
to India long ago about the rugs. I do not know whether Dewanji<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
is alive or dead. I have no
information.</p>
<p>I am all right and will be more than a month yet in New York.
After that I am going to the Thousand Islands &#8212; wherever that place may
be &#8212; for a little summer quiet and rest. Mrs. Bagley has been down here
to see me and attended several of my classes.</p>
<p>The classes are going on with a boom; almost every day I have
one, and they are packed full. But no ""<i>money</i>"" &#8212;
except they maintain themselves. I charge no fees, except as the

<p>DEAR DOCTOR,</p>
<p>I am in this place now and had to change some of my plans on
account of the Toronto Congress.</p>
<p>I am therefore not quite sure whether I will be able to come
to Oak Island Conference. It is very possible, however, that I will be
able to do so.</p>
<p>I also hope Mr. [Charles Carroll] Bonney will come. He is a
noble, noble soul &#8212; one who sincerely wishes the fellowship of all
humanity.</p>
<p>Is it not true, Dr., that Mr. Bonney, as I have every reason

DEAR DOCTOR,

I am in this place now and had to change some of my plans on account of the Toronto Congress.

I am therefore not quite sure whether I will be able to come to Oak Island Conference. It is very possible, however, that I will be able to do so.

I also hope Mr. [Charles Carroll] Bonney will come. He is a noble, noble soul — one who sincerely wishes the fellowship of all humanity.

Is it not true, Dr., that Mr. Bonney, as I have every reason to think, originated the plan of the parliament of religions?

I will certainly try my best to come.

Thanking you very much for your kindness, I remain

P.S. Will you kindly inform me what lines of thought you want me to take.",V.,,136,1,0

<p>Here is another consignment from Raja Ajit Singh [the Maharaja

bill of lading you sent me the other day. This consignment has no <i>duty</i>
to pay because it was all prepaid in India, and the bill of lading says
so expressly. I will send you the bill of lading and the receipt for
the <i>duty</i>. Kindly take one more trouble for me and
get it out of the express company. And keep it with you till I come.
The goods have arrived in New York and I had a notice of that. They are
on their way to Chicago.</p>
<p>In two or three days I will send the bill of lading and the
receipt for duty paid, to you. I foolishly asked Miss Phillips, as soon
as I got the Company's (Original letter: Companies'.) notice, to get
them out before I got the bill of lading. Now the bill of lading shows
that it is bound for Chicago. So I am bound to give you this trouble. I
am so sorry. Again with my usual business instincts &#8212; I forgot to note
down the name of the express company. So I have written to New York for

DEAR MOTHER,

The shirts arrived yesterday; they are nice and fit me well.

Everybody liked them.

Landsberg arrived this morning with a picture of Shri Ramakrishna.

The Toronto affair has fallen through because the clergyman objected to a heathen. There is one invitation from the Christian Union of Oak Beach. I do not know whether I will go there.

As I intend to go to Chicago, in August, I ought to give to the people here all the time I can.

<p>DEAR MOTHER &#8212;</p>
<p>I am afraid I can not come to see you and neither will you
advise me. I am going with a friend (Mr. Francis Leggett.) to Europe,
at his expense. We go first to Paris and from there to London. My
friend will go to Italy and I to London. I will, however, come back to
New York in <i>September</i>. So I am not going away for
good.</p>
<p>I start on the 17th. So you see, it is impossible to come and
go that way for 3 or 4 days.</p>
<!--'Volume 9 Page 67'-->
<p>The package from India ought to have reached by this time. If
they come, (The goods mentioned in Swami Vivekananda's letter dated <a href=""061_mother.htm"">July 2, 1895</a>.) kindly take
the delivery and send it back to New York to Miss Mary Phillips, 19 W.
38. If the package does not come to Chicago before you go away, then
kindly send the bill of lading etc. to Miss Mary Phillips, 19. W. 38.
The babies [the Hale daughters] did not write me a line, nor did they
intimate where they are. I absolutely do not know anything about them.
As they do not want it, it seems I ought not to disturb them with my
letters. But you kindly convey them my love and eternal, undying
blessings. So to you, Mother and Father Pope. I will pen a longer

I am afraid I can not come to see you and neither will you advise me. I am going with a friend (Mr. Francis Leggett.) to Europe, at his expense. We go first to Paris and from there to London. My friend will go to Italy and I to London. I will, however, come back to New York inSeptember. So I am not going away for good.

I start on the 17th. So you see, it is impossible to come and go that way for 3 or 4 days.

The package from India ought to have reached by this time. If they come, (The goods mentioned in Swami Vivekananda's letter datedJuly 2, 1895.) kindly take the delivery and send it back to New York to Miss Mary Phillips, 19 W. 38. If the package does not come to Chicago before you go away, then kindly send the bill of lading etc. to Miss Mary Phillips, 19. W. 38. The babies [the Hale daughters] did not write me a line, nor did they intimate where they are. I absolutely do not know anything about them. As they do not want it, it seems I ought not to disturb them with my letters. But you kindly convey them my love and eternal, undying blessings. So to you, Mother and Father Pope. I will pen a longer epistle in a few days. We will see each other next spring in Chicago, Mother, if we all live.","Ever gratefully your Son,

DEAR CHRISTINA,

You must be enjoying the beautiful weather very much. Here, it is extremely hot but it does not worry me much. I had a pleasant journey from Thousand Islands to New York; and though the Engine was derailed, I did not know anything of it, being asleep all the time. Miss Waldo went out of the train at Albany. I did not see her off as I was asleep. I have not heard anything from her yet. Hope to hear soon. Dr. [L. L. Wight] and Miss [Ruth] Ellis must have gone home by this time.

We gave them a telepathic message but Miss Ellis has not got it sure, else she would write.

I am making preparations for my departure.

I came in time for one of the meetings here and had another one last evening — going to have one more this evening and almost every evening till I go over.

What is Mrs. Funkey [Mary Caroline Funke] doing, and Miss [Mary Elizabeth] Dutcher? Do you go to meditate on the mountain as usual? Did you hear from Kripananda?

Write to me as soon as you can — I am so anxious to hear from you.

The wife, of course, doesn't much care about metaphysics or Sanskrit, but her whole life is in her husband — and husband's soul is in Sanskrit metaphysics! Yet it is a good combination of theory and practice, I think. Write me all about yourselves if you have time and inclination, and give Mother Church my eternal gratitude.

My movements are so, so uncertain. Yet I will be a month more in London.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am once more on American Soil and have taken lodgings at 228 W. 39, where I begin work from Monday next. Sometime after Christmas I intend to make a tour through Detroit and Chicago.

What we want is strength. We Indians, more than any other race, want strong and vigorous thought. We have enough of the superfine in all concerns. For centuries we have been stuffed with the mysterious; the result is that our intellectual and spiritual digestion is almost hopelessly impaired, and the race has been dragged down to the depths of hopeless imbecility — never before or since experienced by any other civilised community. There must be freshness and vigour of thought behind to make a virile race. Morethan enough to strengthen the whole world exists in the Upanishads. The Advaita is the eternal mine of strength. But it requires to beapplied. It must first be cleared of the incrustation of scholasticism, and then in all its simplicity, beauty and sublimity be taught over the length and breadth of the land, as applied even to the minutest detail of daily life. ""This is a very large order""; but we must work towards it, nevertheless, as if it would be accomplished to-morrow. Of one thing I am sure — that whoever wants to help his fellow beings through genuine love and unselfishness will work wonders.","Yours truly,

DEAR MRS. BULL —

Your last letter to Sturdy at hand. They, I am sorry to say, leave us nowhere. I could not make anything out of them.

What are we to do? Is the book going to be published or not? Prof. [William] James's introduction (Preface to Swami Vivekananda'sRâja-Yoga.) is of no use in England. So why wait so long for that; and what use are those long explanations about him?

Your letters are full of explanations [and] directions, but not one wordabout what is to be done!!! So much red tape about printing a little book!! Empires are managed with less manipulation than that, I am sure!! So kindly write at your earliest something precise about the book and whether it is going to be printed or not, and pray make the writing a little legible.

Poor Sturdy is out of his wits as to what to do; he has gone through the Mss. long ago.

Joking apart, I am very sorry you are not coming over this year. We are in Lady Isabel's house. (The house was rented from Lady Isabel Margesson.) Miss [Henrietta] Müller has taken some rooms in it too. Goodwin is here with us. We have not yet made any big stir here. The classes have begun; they are not yet what we expected. We [have] had only two yet.

We will work on steadily the next 4 or 5 months. Sturdy is as patient and persevering and hopeful as ever.

It is cool enough here yet to have a fire in the grate.

<p>Allow me to put a few words in your estimable journal as
comments on an article in your paper dated July 4th. I must thank you
without reserve for the kind and friendly spirit manifested throughout
the article towards me and the philosophy I preach; but, as there is a

correspondence between the living and the dead is, I believe, in every

the Vedantic sects of India, where the fact of mutual help between the
departed and the living has been made the basis of the law of
inheritance. I would be very sorry if I be mistaken as antagonistic to
any sect or form of religion, so far as they are sincere. Nor do I hold
that any system can ever be judged by the frauds and failures that
would naturally gather round every method under the present
circumstances. But, all the same, I cannot but believe that every
thoughtful person would agree with me when I affirm that people should
be warned of their dangers, with love and sympathy. The lecture alluded
to could but accidentally touch the subject of Spiritualism; but I take
this opportunity of conveying my deep admiration for the Spiritualist
community for the positive good they have done already, and are doing
still: (1) the preaching of a universal sympathy; (2) the still greater
work of helping the human race out of doctrines which inculcate fear
and not love. Ever ready to co-operate with, and at the service of, all

DEAR MISS NOBLE,

<p>I haven't received any word of your arrival yet. I heard that

got infuriated and left for Almora. Terribly upset, Miss Müller accused
Shivananda of telling her first that I shall live with a friend as his
guest and of renting later such a big house for the season at 80 rupees
without consulting her. Very cross with everybody, she has been
reproving one and all but has cooled down a little when I said I would
pay half of the rent. . . .</p>
<p>Shashi himself [Swami Ramakrishnananda] should handle the
entire amount of 100 rupees which the Raja of Ramnad is donating (every
month); he should send a detailed account of the monthly income and
expenditure to the Math &#8212; otherwise there won't be any check. Advise
him to spend as little as necessary on Thakur's<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>

ask him to come to Almora &#8212; but only when the boy selected for Shashi

he sent has reached the Math. I have received two volumes of Ramanuja's
commentary. Advise him to send me the third. Ask G. G. [Narasimhachari]
to send me similar commentaries by Madhva and others, if he can.</p>
<p>A public meeting will have to be organized at Madras to
present an address of welcome to the Raja [Ajit Singh] of Khetri and to
Pratap Singh of Jodhpur for their boldness in visiting England as well

My health was not bad in Calcutta; here it is the same — only, the sugar has entirely disappeared, the specific gravity being only 13. I slept very well last night too; but the morning ride up, or climb, of a few miles is proving too much for my adipose tissues. The flannel clothes only made me worse, so I have given them up and have gone to my summer dress and am all right.

I have sent you Sturdy's letter already — poor fellow — I do not know what to do for him. He is really ""living in a desert of his own making"" — you see, one thing is not good for every one. Marriage has indeed proved a hell for Sturdy. And he can not come, although ""he is skirting the coast of India"". Lord help the poor boy. May He cut all his bonds and make him free soon. Aye, it is good that he is feeling the bondage — and not ""hugging and kissing its spokes of agony"".

YOUR HIGHNESS —

Many thanks for your kind note and the Nimbarka Bhashya — reached through Jaga Mohan Lalji.

I approach your Highness today on a most important business of mine, knowing well that I have not the least shame in opening my mind to you, and that I consider you as myonly friendin this life. If the following appeals to you, good; if not, pardon my foolishness as a friend should.

As you know already, I have been ailing since my return. In Calcutta your Highness assured me of your friendship and help for me personally and [advised me] not to be worried about this incurable malady. This disease has been caused by nervous excitement; and no amount of change can do me good, unless the worry and anxiety and excitement are taken off me.

After trying these two years a different climate, I am getting worse every day and now almost at death's door. I appeal to your Highness's work, generosity and friendship. I have one great sin rankling always in my breast, and that is [in order] to do a service to the world, I have sadly neglected my mother. Again, since my second brother has gone away, she has become awfully worn-out with grief. Now my last desire is to make Sevâ [give service] and serve my mother, for some years at least.

<p>Excuse this long delay in replying to your very beautiful
note. The fact is, I was once more in the vale of death. The old
diabetes has now disappeared. In its place has come what some doctors
call asthma, others dyspepsia, owing to nervous prostration. However,
it is a most worrying disease, giving one the sensation of suffocation
&#8212; sometimes for days. I am best only in Calcutta; so I am here for rest
and quiet and low diet. If I get well by March, I am going to start for
Europe. Mrs. Bull and others are gone; sorry I could not accompany them
owing to this disease.</p>
<p>I have carefully weighed your plans for coming over. I will be
ever so glad to see you, you know it well; but, my dear, the Indian
summer will not suit you, and if you start now it will be midsummer
when you reach India. Then, you must not hope of making any living
here. It is impossible for me to make a living most times in my own
country. Then all the surroundings are so, so wretched and different
from what you see around you, e.g. you will find me going about in
loin-cloth &#8212; will that shock you? Three-fourths of the population only
wearing a strip of white cloth about their loins &#8212; can you bear that?</p>
<p>I must stop here; I am so weak. If I do not get well by March,
I will write you to come, for I wish it ever so much to see you once

going to study in America, and Miss [Margaret] Noble. Miss Noble is a
young lady from Wimbledon, near London, who has been working in India
on the education of girls.</p>
<p>Our stay in England will not be long, I am afraid, as this is
neither the season nor am I in fit condition to work much. Anyhow, we
will be in London a few weeks &#8212; at least myself &#8212; then go to the U.S.
We will talk over all this and infinite things besides when we meet. I
do not think even English summer days are long enough for all the
chatter I will assail you with.</p>
<p>We go to Wimbledon for a day or two, and then I come back to
London and find lodgings for myself and make plans.</p>
<p>Come to the Dock if that is possible and discreet. Yes, it is
discreet, as there is a lady in the party and others will come to meet
her. Only, Christina, don't if you feel the least tired or unwell. I
hope you are enjoying London immensely.</p>
<p>The Orientals do not like any effusion of feeling. They are
trained to hide all expression.</p>
<p>Is Mrs. Funkey [Mary Caroline Funke] with you? If so, give her
my best love.</p>
<p>I am much, much better just now. I am really quite another man
this time. I was nearly dead in Calcutta when I started, but this
voyage has improved me immensely.</p>

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Your very, very welcome wire just came. By next Sunday1we arrive in London, Albert Dock.2We are a party of four: myself, another Sannyasin,3a Calcutta boy4going to study in America, and Miss [Margaret] Noble. Miss Noble is a young lady from Wimbledon, near London, who has been working in India on the education of girls.

Our stay in England will not be long, I am afraid, as this is neither the season nor am I in fit condition to work much. Anyhow, we will be in London a few weeks — at least myself — then go to the U.S. We will talk over all this and infinite things besides when we meet. I do not think even English summer days are long enough for all the chatter I will assail you with.

We go to Wimbledon for a day or two, and then I come back to London and find lodgings for myself and make plans.

Come to the Dock if that is possible and discreet. Yes, it is discreet, as there is a lady in the party and others will come to meet her. Only, Christina, don't if you feel the least tired or unwell. I hope you are enjoying London immensely.

The Orientals do not like any effusion of feeling. They are trained to hide all expression.

Is Mrs. Funkey [Mary Caroline Funke] with you? If so, give her my best love.

I am much, much better just now. I am really quite another man this time. I was nearly dead in Calcutta when I started, but this voyage has improved me immensely.

Hoping soon to see you,","Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.",,276,6,0

<p>MY DEAR MOTHER CHURCH,</p>
<p>Many, many thanks for your kind words.</p>
<p>I am so glad you are working on as ever. I am glad because the
wave of optimism has not caught you yet. It is all very well to say
everything is right, but that is apt to degenerate into a sort of <i>laissez-faire</i>.
I believe with you that the world is evil &#8212; made more hideous with a

<p>All our works have only this value, that they awaken some to
the reality of this horror &#8212; and [those] flee for refuge to some place
beyond, which is called God, or Christ, or Brahma, or Buddha, etc.
Names do not make much difference.</p>
<p>Again, we must always remember ours is only to work &#8212; we never
attain results. How can we? Good can never be done without doing evil.
We cannot breathe a breath without killing thousands of poor little
animals. National prosperity is another name for death and degradation
to millions of other races. So is individual prosperity the beggaring
of many. The world is evil &#8212; and will ever remain so. It is its nature,
and cannot be changed &#8212; ""Which one of you by taking thought . . ."" etc.
(Matthew 6.27.)</p>
<p>Such is truth. The wisdom is therefore in renunciation, that
is, to make the Lord our all in all. Be a true Christian, Mother &#8212; like
Christ, renounce everything and let the heart and soul and body belong
to Him and Him alone. All this nonsense which people have built round
Christ's name is not His teaching. He taught to renounce. He never says
the earth is an enjoyable place. And your time has come to get rid of

<p>MY DEAR MOTHER,</p>
<p>I was taking a few days' complete rest and so am late in
replying to your very kind note. Accept my congratulations on the
anniversary of your marriage. I pray many, many such returns may come
to you.</p>
<p>I am sure my previous letter was coloured by the state of my
body, as indeed is the whole of existence to us. Yet, Mother, there is
more pain than pleasure in life. If not, why do I remember you and your
children almost every day of my life, and not many others? Happiness is
liked so much because it is so rare, is it not? Fifty percent of our
life is mere lethargy, ennui; of the rest, forty percent is pain, only
ten happiness &#8212; and this for the exceptionally fortunate. We are
oft-times mixing up this state of ennui with pleasure. It is rather a
negative state, whilst both pleasure and pain are nearer positive,
though not positive.</p>
<p>Pleasure and pain are both <i>feeling</i>, not <i>willing</i>.
They are only processes which convey to the mind excitements or motives
of action. The real positive action is the willing, or impulse to work,
of the mind &#8212; begun when the sensation has been taken in (pleasure and
pain); thus the real is neither pleasure nor pain. It has no connection
with either. Quite different from either. The barking of the dog
awakens his master to guard against a thief or receive his dearest
friend. It does not follow, therefore, that the dog and his master are
of the same nature or have any degree of kinship. The feelings of
pleasure or pain similarly awaken the soul to activity, without any
kinship at all.</p>
<p>The soul is beyond pain, beyond pleasure, sufficient in its
own nature. And no hell can punish it, nor any heaven can bless it. So
far philosophy.</p>
<p>I am coming soon to Chicago, and hope to say ""Lord bless you""
to you and your children. All love as usual to my Christian relatives,
scientific or quacks.</p>

I am sure my previous letter was coloured by the state of my body, as indeed is the whole of existence to us. Yet, Mother, there is more pain than pleasure in life. If not, why do I remember you and your children almost every day of my life, and not many others? Happiness is liked so much because it is so rare, is it not? Fifty percent of our life is mere lethargy, ennui; of the rest, forty percent is pain, only ten happiness — and this for the exceptionally fortunate. We are oft-times mixing up this state of ennui with pleasure. It is rather a negative state, whilst both pleasure and pain are nearer positive, though not positive.

Pleasure and pain are bothfeeling, notwilling. They are only processes which convey to the mind excitements or motives of action. The real positive action is the willing, or impulse to work, of the mind — begun when the sensation has been taken in (pleasure and pain); thus the real is neither pleasure nor pain. It has no connection with either. Quite different from either. The barking of the dog awakens his master to guard against a thief or receive his dearest friend. It does not follow, therefore, that the dog and his master are of the same nature or have any degree of kinship. The feelings of pleasure or pain similarly awaken the soul to activity, without any kinship at all.

The soul is beyond pain, beyond pleasure, sufficient in its own nature. And no hell can punish it, nor any heaven can bless it. So far philosophy.

I am coming soon to Chicago, and hope to say ""Lord bless you"" to you and your children. All love as usual to my Christian relatives, scientific or quacks.",VIVEKANANDA,,343,1,0

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Circumstances have so fallen that I have to start for California tomorrow. It is for my physical benefit too; as the doctor says, I had better be off where the severe winter of the North cannot reach.

Well, thus my plans are made and marred. Anyway — come over to Cambridge when you feel like it. Mrs. Bull will only be too happy to do anything for you she can.

I hope to stop in Detroit on my way back. The Lord's will — as we say.","Ever yours in the Lord,

<p>MY DEAR CHRISTINA,</p>
<p>After all, it is good for me, and good for those I love, that
I should come here. Here at last in California! One of our poets says:
""Where is Benares, where is Kashmir, where Khorasan, where Gujarat! O
Tulsi! thus, man's past Karma drags him on"". And I am here. After all
it is best, isn't it? Are you going to Boston? I am afraid you are not.
I have not unsettled any of your plans, have I? &#8212; unnecessary expenses?
Well, if any, I will make it up. Only the trouble is yours. I am
ashamed of my eccentricities. Well, how are you? What are you doing?
How are things going with you? Sleep if you can; it is better to sleep
than get awakened. I pray that all good may come to thee &#8212; all peace,
all strength to do and suffer. I have a great deal of strength to do,
but very little to suffer.</p>
<p>I am so selfish again, always thinking of my own sufferings
and paying no heed to others. Pray for me; send strong thoughts that I
may have strength to suffer. I know you will. Now, I mean to remain a
few weeks in this city. After that, ""Mother"" knows. I am physically
much better now than I have been for months. The weakness of the heart
is nearly gone. The dyspepsia is also much better, and [there is] very
little. I can walk miles now without feeling it in the heart. If this
continues, I expect to have a new lease on life. I am so, so sorry of
asking you to come to Boston and flying away. If you are there, I hope
you will enjoy the place and the meetings. If you have given it up &#8212;
well, did you take leave and not go to Boston? My! what a bungle! Well,
I ask a thousand pardons, if such is the case. Things must look
brighter anyway, sooner or later. What of these little, few days of
life!</p>
<p>How is Mrs. Funke? Loads of love for her. How long a leave
[do] you get at Christmas? When does it begin? If you feel inclined and
willing, write me a long note, will you? But don't tell my friends my
whereabouts. I want to be off from the world<!--'Volume 9 Page 131'-->
for a time, if I can. Will you kindly send Mr. Freer's address to Mrs.

crowded, as there was very little ad[vertisement], but a fairly good &#8212;
sized audience though. I hope they were pleased. If I feel better, I am
going to have classes in this city soon. I am on the business path this

<p>So you are awake and can't go to sleep any more. Good! Keep
awake, wide awake. It was good I came here. For, in the first place, I
am cured. What do you think of this &#8212; able to walk, and every day walk
three miles after a heavy dinner! Good! Isn't it?</p>
<p>I am making money fast &#8212; twenty-five dollars a day now. Soon I
will work more and get fifty dollars a day. In San Francisco I hope to
do still better &#8212; where I go in two or three weeks. Good again &#8212;
better, say I &#8212; as I am going to keep the money all to myself and not
squander it any more. And then I will buy a little place in the
Himalayas &#8212; a whole hill &#8212; about say, six thousand feet high with a
grand view of the eternal<!--'Volume 9 Page 132'--> snows.
There must be springs and a tiny lake. Cedars &#8212; the Himalayan cedar

DEAR CHRISTINA,

So you are awake and can't go to sleep any more. Good! Keep awake, wide awake. It was good I came here. For, in the first place, I am cured. What do you think of this — able to walk, and every day walk three miles after a heavy dinner! Good! Isn't it?

I am making money fast — twenty-five dollars a day now. Soon I will work more and get fifty dollars a day. In San Francisco I hope to do still better — where I go in two or three weeks. Good again — better, say I — as I am going to keep the money all to myself and not squander it any more. And then I will buy a little place in the Himalayas — a whole hill — about say, six thousand feet high with a grand view of the eternalsnows. There must be springs and a tiny lake. Cedars — the Himalayan cedar forests — and flowers, flowers everywhere. I will have a little cottage; in the middle, my vegetable gardens, which I will work myself — and — and — and — my books — and see the face of man only once in a great while. And the world may go to ruin round about my ears, I would not care. I will have done with all my work — secular or spiritual — and retire. My! how restless I have been all my life! Born nomad. I don't know; this is the present vision. The future is to come yet.

DEAR JOE —

Your note enclosing two from France and three from India just received. I have had general good news and am happy.

Financially, I have got $300 in Los Angeles. About Mrs. Bowler,1she has about a hundred odd dollars in cash. Mrs. Hendrick and she have not paid up as yet. That money — $300 in all — is with her. She will send it to me whenever I write.

Rev. Benjamin Fay Mills,2a very popular Unitarian preacher in Oakland, invited me from here and paid the fare toSan Francisco. I have spoken twice in Oakland to 1500 people each time. Last time I got from collection $30. I am going to have classes at 50 cents admission each.

San Francisco had one lecture the other night [February 23] at 50¢ each. It paid its expenses. This Monday [Sunday?] I am going to speak free — after that a class.

I went to see Mrs. Hurst [Hearst].3She was not at home. I left a card — so with Prof. Le Conte.4

Mary [Hale] writes that you wrote her of my coming any day to the East. I don't know. Here I have a large following — ready — made by my books. Will get some money, not much. St. Francis [Francis Leggett] may put the money in the bank for me — but can that be done without my signature? And I am here? It is good if it can be done. Did you see any possibility of my books being sold for good to any publisher?

The French invitation5is all right. But it seems impossible to write any decent paper on the subject we chose. Because if I have to lecture and make money, very little time will be left for anything else. Again, I can not find any books (Sanskrit) here. So let me try to make a little money if I can and go to France all the same, but send them no paper. No scholarly work can be done in this haphazard and hurried fashion. It means time and study.

My stomach is very, very good and nerves fine. I am getting on. A few days more and I will be all right. I received your letter with the enclosed.

If you leave for New York soon, take my mail with you. I am coming to New York direct. If you leave New York before I leave, put my mail in a cover and deposit with Turiyananda, and tell him to keep it for me and not to open it on any account, nor any one of my Indian letters. Turiyananda will take charge. Also see that my clothes and books are at the Vedanta Society's rooms in New York.

I will write you more soon — an introduction to Mrs. Huntington.1This affair should be private.

With love and blessings,

P.S. As I have got to stop at Chicago for my ticket, will you ask anybody to take me in for a day or two, if Mrs. Hale is gone East by that time?",V.,,203,1,0

<p>I could not write more, as the last few weeks of my stay in
California was one more relapse and great suffering. However, I got one

<p>I wrote you one, however, from 770 Oak Street, San Francisco,

my address book was not in the place I was in. There was a mistake in
number. I cannot believe you did not reply willingly.</p>
<p>As you see, now I am in New York, and will be here a few days.
I have an invitation from Mrs. Walton of Cleveland, Ohio. I have
accepted it. She writes me you are also invited and have accepted her
invitation. Well, we will meet in Cleveland then. I am sure to see you
before I go to Europe &#8212; either there or anywhere you wish. If you don't
think it would be possible for you to come to Ohio, I will come to any
other place you want me to come to say goodbye.</p>
<p>When is your school going to close? Write me all about your
plans &#8212; do!</p>
<p>Miss Noble wants me very much to go to Cleveland. I would be
very, very glad to get a few weeks' seclusion and rest before I start
with friends who do not disturb me at all. I know I will find rest and
peace that way, and you can help me any amount in that. In Cleveland,
of course, there will be a few friends always and much talkee-talkee as

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am getting better every day, only this New York is a bad place for sleep. Again, I am working some, though not hard, to get the old friends together and put the thing in shape.

Now, you know, I will in a week or so finish this work and then be ready for a real quiet of a week or two or more.

Detroit, alas! will be no better than New York. With so many old friends! How can you avoid friends whom you really love?

I will have perfect freedom at yours — sure — but how can I avoid seeing friends and the eternal visiting and paying visits and much talkee-talkee? Do you know any other place within eight or ten hours (I want to avoid night rides) of riding from New York where I can be quiet and free from the people? (Lord bless them.) I am dead tired seeing people just now. Just think of that and everything else; if, after all, you think Detroit is the best place for me, I am ready to come.

Terrible rolling all through. Only last night I had good sleep. On other occasions the rolling makes me sleep well, but this time I don't know what was the matter; the mind was so whirling. Anyway, I am well and soon to reach land.

Hope to reach Paris this evening.

I send this to Detroit, expecting you there.","With all love and blessings,

DEAR MOTHER,

I am sorry to learn you are not well. Hope you will soon be better. Things seem to turn out better for me.

Mr. Maxim of the gun fame is very much interested in me, and he wants to put in his book on China and the Chinese something about my work in America.1I have not any documents with me; if you have, kindly give them to him. He will come to see you and talk it over with you. Canon Hawes [Reverend Hugh Reginald Haweis] also keeps track of my work in England. So much about that. It may be that Mother will now work up my original plan of international work. In that case, you will find your work of the Conference2has not been in vain.

It seems that after this fall in my health, physical and mental, it is going to open out that way — larger and more international work. Mother knows best.

My whole life has been divided into successive depressions and rises — and so, I believe, is the life of everyone. I am glad, rather than not, these falls come. I understand it all; still, I suffer and grumble and rage!! Perhaps that is a part of the cause of the next upheaval.

I think you will be in America by the time we return; if not, I will see you in London again. Anyhow, adieu for the present. We start day after tomorrow for Egypt etc. And all blessings ever be on you and yours is, as always, my prayer.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

The subsequent proceedings have been so much interesting; and the interest has been growing so rapidly of late, that one could scarcely utter a word.1

I am glad to learn of Mrs. [Ole] Bull's sweet letter to you; she is an angel. You are peaceful and happy — good. I am growing towards it too.

I am en route to Chandranath on pilgrimage.

I have been anxiously awaiting a letter from you, and it seemed it would never come.

I am sure to be happy — can't help thinking so. After so much struggle, the result must come. Things take their own course; it is I who am to brighten up, I find. And I am tryingmy best. And you can help me by writing nice letters now and then; will you?

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Your very welcome letter just reached. A few days ago a precious little bit of poem also reached. I wish it ever so much you were the writer thereof. Anyhow, most of us feel, though unable to express; and then, ""There are thoughts that lie too deep for tears"". Regularity in anything is not in my line of life, but that need not make you irregular. I pray you to drop a few lines every now and then. Of course, when I am not in this body, I am sure the news will reach you, and then you will have to stop writing.

Miss MacLeod wishes me to join her in Japan, but I am not sure. Most probably I am not going, especially as I expect both her and Mrs. Ole Bull in India, in November. Two whole months consumed in coming and going; only one month's stay in Japan — that does not pay, I am afraid.

Say, I am getting enormously fat about the middle — alas!

Mrs. [Charlotte] Sevier, who is now in England, returns in a few months to India. She has invited Mrs. Bull etc. to be her guests in the Himalayas. I wish they could be there during summer.

I have manfully borne the terrific heat of my country in the plains, and now I am facing the deluging rains of my country. Do you know how I am taking rest? I have got a few goats and sheep and cows and dogs and cranes! And I am taking care of them the whole day! It is not trying to be happy; what for? Why should one not be unhappy as well — both being nonsense? — but just to kill time.

Do you correspond with Mrs. Bull or Nivedita?

Don't worry, don't be anxious; for me the ""Mother"" is my protection and refuge; and everything must come round soon, better than my fondest dreams can paint.","With all love,

DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,</p>
<p class=""right""><i>2nd September 1901.</i></p>
<p>MY DEAR CHRISTINE,</p>
<p>I have been looking at one of your old photos &#8212; the only one
you sent four or five years ago; and then I remember how changed and
reduced you looked last summer; and it came to me that you must be
awfully thin now, as it seems very hard for you to get rid of
anxieties. This is simply foolish. Things will, of course, take their
shape. We only make ourselves miserable by moping. It is very hard to
manipulate one's philosophy to contribute to one's daily need. So it is
with you, as with me. But it is easiest to take the teacher's chair and
read a lecture. And that has been my life's business!! Indeed, that is
the reason why there are more disciples up to the mark than teachers.
The upshot of all this is that you must create a huge appetite, then
gorge, then sleep and grow fat, fat, fat. Plump is the English word, is
it not?</p>
<!--'Volume 9 Page 163'-->
<p>As for me, I am very happy. Of course, Bengal brings the
asthma now and then, but it is getting tame, and the terrible things &#8212;
Bright's disease and diabetes &#8212; have disappeared altogether. Life in
any dry climate will stop the asthma completely, I am sure. I get
reduced, of course, during a fit, but then it takes me no time to lay
on a few layers of fat. I have a lot of cows, goats, a few sheep, dogs,
geese, ducks, one tame gazelle, and very soon I am going to have some
milk buffaloes. These are not your American bison, but huge things &#8212;
hairless, half-aquatic in habits, and [that] give an enormous quantity
of very rich milk.</p>
<p>Within the last few months, I got two fits [of asthma] by
going to two of the dampest hill stations in Bengal &#8212; Shillong and
Darjeeling. I am not going to try the Bengalee mountains any more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bull and Nivedita are in Norway. I don't know when they
[will] come over to India. Miss MacLeod is in Japan. I have not heard
from her [for] a long while. They all are expected here in November,
and will have a ""hot time in this old town""<a name=""t1""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn1"">1</a>
etc. I pray you can come, and the Mother will open the door for it. I
cannot but say my prayers mostly have been heard, up to date.</p>
<p>Well now, Christina, send me one of your latest photos next
mail, will you? I want to see how much of fat you have accumulated in
one year.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I will have to go to America with Mrs. Bull, I am
sure. [Excision]<a name=""t2""></a><a class=""fnote"" href=""#fn2"">2</a>

season.</p>

yet. My whole body is covered by big patches of prickly heat. Thank
goodness there are no ladies about! If I had to cover myself in this

<p>I have also my theme, but I am not despondent. I am sure very
soon to pan it out into a beautiful ecstasy [excision]. I am half crazy

a result I don't find anybody who would patiently bear with me! I am
trying my best to make myself gentle as a lamb. I hope I shall succeed
in some birth. You are so gentle. Sometimes I did frighten you very
much, did I not, Christina? I wish I were as gentle as you are. Mother
knows which is best.</p>
<p>I would not take any supper tonight, as I ate rather heartily
of the aforesaid shad! Then I have to think, think, think on my theme;

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Yours of September 9 came to hand yesterday. I congratulate you on your successful visit to the Huron Lake; a few more of them (according to your letter) will force you to sympathize with our condition — oh, the gasping and the melting and the puffing and all the rest of them!

However, nothing in the world like a plump, ripe fruit.

I had to give up my trip to Japan: firstly, because I am not in a working trim yet; secondly, [I] don't much care to make such a long voyage (one month) alone; thirdly, what am I to talk to them, I wonder.

Our heat too has been fierce and is continuing unusually long this year. I am blacker than a Negro by this time.

The California work is progressing famously. They want one or two men more. I would send, if I could, but I have not any more spare men. Poor Turiyananda is suffering from malaria yet, and is awfully overworked.

Do you know whether they published myJnana-Yogaor not? I got a copy of a second edition ofKarma-Yogaonly.

I am bobbing up and down in the current of life. Today it is rather down, so I finish the letter here.","Yours with all love and blessings,

<p>DEAR CHRISTINA,</p>
<p>The morning's mail brought me a photograph from Detroit. I
thank the sender very much for promptness. Well, I liked it much. But
the old one is the profile view; this, the front. Then again, the
phenomenal fat seems to be only imaginary on somebody's part. In a way,
I am more used to the old one, and, as such, I cannot slight an old

here: ""One river is equal to forty miles"". There is only a river

<p>Mrs. [Ole] Bull and Nivedita must have started for the U.S. by
this time. Nivedita is sure to see you in Detroit. Mrs. Bull is anxious
to induce you to join her Indian party via Japan. If you can take leave
for some months, do come. Mother will arrange anyhow; I need not
trouble myself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sevier has started already, it seems &#8212; alone.</p>
<p>We had grand Pujas (worships) here in our Math this year. The
biggest of our Pujas is the Mother worship, lasting nearly four days
and nights. We brought a clay image of Mother with ten hands, standing
with one foot on a lion, the other on a demon. Her two daughters &#8212; the
Goddess of Wealth and the Goddess of Learning and Music &#8212; on either
side on lotuses; beneath, her two sons &#8212; the God of War and that of
Wisdom.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were entertained, but I could not see the
Puja, alas! I was down with high fever all the time. Day before
yesterday, however, came the Puja of Kali. We had an image, too, and
sacrificed a goat and burned a lot of fireworks. This night every Hindu
home is illuminated, and the boys go crazy over fireworks. There are,
of course, several cases of severe burns in the hospitals. We had less
fireworks but more Puja, recitation of Mantras, offering of flowers,
food and songs. It lasted only one night.</p>
<p>I am expected to leave Calcutta and Bengal in a few days, as
this country becomes very malarious this month, after the rains. It is

<p>DEAR CHRISTINE,</p>
<p>It is almost sure, I did not write any letter to you that week
in which [I] made that infamous blunder. As I wrote you two letters a
few days previously, it is not at all probable that I wrote you
another. Then Miss [Josephine] MacLeod [would have] sent the letter
back. I must have written only one letter that week to Miss MacLeod,
giving her my reasons for not going to Japan; and somehow it so
happened that the hand wrote the most familiar name on the envelope. So
you need not expect any letter of yours back from Japan, as there was
none; and if there were, you shall have it.</p>
<p>I am just under another spell of catarrh and asthma. Yesterday
a cyclone blew over the place, and several trees and a bit of the roof
are damaged. It is gloomy yet and cold. You know it is almost
impossible to write with the asthma on. So <i>au revoir</i>

<p>DEAR CHRISTINE,</p>
<p>Well, then, you wanted to know all about my state of health,
and you insist. You shall have it.</p>
<p>You know, the last three years I have been getting albuminuria
now and then. It is not constant, nor is it yet of any organic
character. The kidneys are structurally all right. Only they throw out
albumen now and then.</p>
<p>This is worse than throwing out sugar in diabetes. Albumen
poisons the blood, attacks the heart and does all sorts of mischief.
Catching cold always increases it. This time it has caused<!--'Volume 9 Page 172'-->
a small blood vessel in the right eye to burst, so that I scarcely see
with that eye.</p>
<p>Then the circulation has become very rapid. The doctors have
put me to bed; and I am forbidden to eat meat, to walk or even stand
up, to read and write.</p>
<p>Already there is some benefit in this lying-down process, as I
sleep a lot and have a good appetite and am digesting my meals.
Curious, is it not, that inactivity should bring on sleep and appetite?
There is no cause to be anxious at all.</p>
<p>Mrs. [Charlotte] Sevier arrived in Calcutta three days ago;
and by the last advice from Nivedita, Mrs. Bull and she will start on
the 13th December, if they can secure berths, or on the 30th December
at least. I pray Mrs. Bull has already invited you and that you have
got your year's leave and are coming over, and that you will get this
letter in India redirected. If Mother does not fulfil this prayer, sure
She will take me across the water soon, and [line excised] . . . . The
doctor says if I keep to my bed for three months, I will get completely
cured.</p>
<p>Now, don't worry. If good days are not coming, we will make
them, that is all. Hang it! I must have good days now and, that too,
very soon. You know, I always keep my word. Mother must do it, or I
throw Her overboard. I am not so submissive as you are.</p>
<p>Our old-school physicians pour in tons of iron and other
metals &#8212; including gold, silver, pearls, etc. &#8212; down our throats. I
should be a man of iron by this time; perhaps yours will be the last
touch to make my body one of steel.</p>
<p>This is our best season for eating turtles, but they are all
black. The green [ones] can only be found in America. Alas! I am
prevented from the taste of meat.</p>
<p>Now, noble heart, take courage. Don't mope: you have buffeted
[too] many a storm in life, old war horse, to be like a silly
boarding-school girl. Things must go all right. I am not going to die
or to be ill just now; I am determined to be healthy. You know my grit.</p>
<p>Miss [Josephine] MacLeod sent you your letter. What was it
about? Was there anything queer? I am glad she had it. She writes
beautifully about you. She has already started, and we will have a
jolly good company this winter here in Calcutta.<!--'Volume 9 Page 173'-->
Mrs. [Ole] Bull, Miss MacLeod, Mrs. Sevier and Nivedita and I will be
overjoyed if somebody else will be thrown into the bargain. I can't get
any more value, eh? I must stop. Am going to look after my geese and
ducks just for five minutes, breaking the doctor's command to lie down
all the time. One of the geese is a silly, fearful bird, always
despondent and anxious. She likes to be all alone by herself and is
miserable &#8212; very much like another goose I know in another place.</p>

DEAR CHRISTINE,

Well, then, you wanted to know all about my state of health, and you insist. You shall have it.

You know, the last three years I have been getting albuminuria now and then. It is not constant, nor is it yet of any organic character. The kidneys are structurally all right. Only they throw out albumen now and then.

This is worse than throwing out sugar in diabetes. Albumen poisons the blood, attacks the heart and does all sorts of mischief. Catching cold always increases it. This time it has causeda small blood vessel in the right eye to burst, so that I scarcely see with that eye.

Then the circulation has become very rapid. The doctors have put me to bed; and I am forbidden to eat meat, to walk or even stand up, to read and write.

Already there is some benefit in this lying-down process, as I sleep a lot and have a good appetite and am digesting my meals. Curious, is it not, that inactivity should bring on sleep and appetite? There is no cause to be anxious at all.

Mrs. [Charlotte] Sevier arrived in Calcutta three days ago; and by the last advice from Nivedita, Mrs. Bull and she will start on the 13th December, if they can secure berths, or on the 30th December at least. I pray Mrs. Bull has already invited you and that you have got your year's leave and are coming over, and that you will get this letter in India redirected. If Mother does not fulfil this prayer, sure She will take me across the water soon, and [line excised] . . . . The doctor says if I keep to my bed for three months, I will get completely cured.

<p>DEAR CHRISTINE,</p>
<p>I am much better, and the rest is doing me good. I have found

<p>Mrs. Bull and Nivedita start for India from Marseilles today,
and unless they change their plan, [they] must be in India before this
reaches you &#8212; two weeks before.</p>
<p>Herewith I send you four hundred and eighty dollars by cheque
drawn on Thomas Cook &amp; Son, Broadway, New York. They have no
branch office in Detroit. On receipt of this, you write to Thomas Cook
&amp; Son, Broadway, New York, that you have got a cheque from
India &#8212; mentioning the amount and number &#8212; drawn by Thomas Cook
&amp; Son on the firm of Thomas Cook &amp; Son, and want to be
advised as to how to cash it. Don't send the cheque ahead. (Excuse all
these details. I feel you are a baby in business, though I am worse.)

if you think fit to accept Mrs. Sevier's invitation. If you get leave

come with them as far as Italy, thence direct on a boat to India.</p>
<p>Second-class passage across the Atlantic is all right, but the
second class from Italy to Bombay is rather bad. There are always a few
rough men and fast women. There is money enough for travelling first
class all through, if you so like.</p>
<p>The Mother will see to it, even as [She did when] this money
came. Drop me a line as soon as you engage your passage &#8212;better a week
ahead; otherwise I don't see how the letter can reach me. The vessel to
India you get from London; and possibly a letter may reach me with the
name of the vessel, etc. In any case, however, you wire me as soon as
you land and get into a <i>good</i> hotel. You will find
many persons to receive you &#8212; and me too, most probably.</p>
<p>In case, however, things take another turn and you cannot

<p>It is very probable that after Miss [Josephine] MacLeod and

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

I am sorry I could not visit the mountains this time. My health, though not improved as much as I [had] wished, is notbad. The liver has been benefited — [that] is a great gain. The rains will commence very soon in the hills. So it is useless for me to take all the trouble of that terrible route.

I am so happy to learn the mountains are doing you good. Eat a lot, sleep as much as you can, and get plump. Stuff yourself till you get plump or you burst.

So the place did not suit Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo] — why? There must have been something to annoy him very much that he left the place so abruptly. Did he not like the scenery? Was it not sublime enough for him? Or the Japanese do not like sublimity at all? They only like beauty.

One of the boys writes that the little boy is getting disobedient etc. Mrs. Sevier wants me to take him down. So I do. I have asked Sadananda and another monk (whom I want for work here) to go to Almora and wait for the monsoon, and when it breaks, to come down.

If you feel you are becoming the least burdensome to Mrs. Sevier, write me immediately. It would be a sin to put further pressure on her — she does so much for me. However, she likes you very much and writes that you look be-au-ti-ful in saris.

I have just now two kids and three lambs added to the family. There was one more kid, but he got himself drowned in the yellow fish tank. How is Margot? Is she still there, or gone away with Mr. Okakura? How is she pulling on with the boys?

What do you do the whole day? How do you pass the day? Write me all details, and frequently; but do not expect long letters from me often.

Give my love to Mrs. Sevier, to Margot and the rest, and you may take a few spoonfuls, if you like,

<p class=""right""><i>7th Feb</i>.<i> 1902</i>.</p>
<p>MY DEAR JOE &#8212;</p>
<p>We have safely reached Benaras, and Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo] has
already done Benaras. He goes to see <i>Sarnath</i> (the
old Buddhistic place) today and starts on his tour tomorrow.</p>
<p>He has asked Niranjan [Swami Niranjanananda] to accompany him
and he has consented.</p>
<p>Kanay [Nirbhayananda] has supplied him with everything he
asked for &#8212; and he asks me also to send you the accounts. This, on the
other page.</p>
<p>I hope Nivedita and Mrs. [Ole] Bull have safely arrived. I am
rather better than at Buddha Gaya. This house is nice &#8212; well furnished
and has a good many rooms and parlours. There is a big garden all round
and beautiful roses &#8212; and gigantic trees. It is rather cooler here than
at Gaya. There was no hitch to our friends being admitted into the
chief temple and [allowed to] touch the Sign of Shiva and to worship.
The Buddhists, it seems, are always admitted.</p>
<p>With all love and welcome to Mrs. Bull and Nivedita &#8212; if they
have arrived &#8212; and all to you,</p>

MY DEAR JOE —

We have safely reached Benaras, and Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo] has already done Benaras. He goes to seeSarnath(the old Buddhistic place) today and starts on his tour tomorrow.

He has asked Niranjan [Swami Niranjanananda] to accompany him and he has consented.

Kanay [Nirbhayananda] has supplied him with everything he asked for — and he asks me also to send you the accounts. This, on the other page.

I hope Nivedita and Mrs. [Ole] Bull have safely arrived. I am rather better than at Buddha Gaya. This house is nice — well furnished and has a good many rooms and parlours. There is a big garden all round and beautiful roses — and gigantic trees. It is rather cooler here than at Gaya. There was no hitch to our friends being admitted into the chief temple and [allowed to] touch the Sign of Shiva and to worship. The Buddhists, it seems, are always admitted.

With all love and welcome to Mrs. Bull and Nivedita — if they have arrived — and all to you,

DEAR JOE —

I received a note yesterday from Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo]. They have seen Agra on their way to Gwalior. They must be there now.

The wire he sent to Japan was to Mr. [Tokuno] Oda to come immediately. There was a work. ""Six"" in it also.

It is quite cool here even now — and will remain so for this month at least. Is it getting warm in Calcutta?

I hope Mrs. [Ole] Bull and Nivedita are getting well rested after that tremendous journey.

I am so so.

Well, many thanks for all the information I got. Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo]
has been to the Math, but I was away. He will be in Calcutta a few
weeks more and then goes to Bombay. He intends taking a house near the
city to learn intimately the customs of Bengalees. I am so glad to
learn Margo's [Sister Nivedita's] intention to stop at Mayavati longer.
She really requires good rest, and she had none in Europe, I am sure of

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

Your letters had to wait a few days, as I was out of town in a village.1Well, many thanks for all the information I got. Mr. Okakura [Kakuzo] has been to the Math, but I was away. He will be in Calcutta a few weeks more and then goes to Bombay. He intends taking a house near the city to learn intimately the customs of Bengalees. I am so glad to learn Margo's [Sister Nivedita's] intention to stop at Mayavati longer. She really requires good rest, and she had none in Europe, I am sure of that. If she were amenable to my advice as of old, I would take away every book and every scrap of paper from her, make her walk some, eat a lot and sleep a lot more. As to talking, I would have the merriest conversation all the while.

I have a beautiful letter from Mrs. Sevier, and [am] so happy to learn that she loves you more and more. But plumpness is the criterion,mon amie[my friend], for a' [all] that.

So there was a great flutter in our dovecote owing to my letters, but things must have assumed their old form by this time. The boy, my nephew, is going to be sometime yet in the Ashrama; make him talk English with a good accent — do. No foreign language can be learnt properly unless you talk in it from childhood.

Mr. Bose2is still there, I hope; and you must have liked him immensely. He is aman, a brick. Tender him my best regards, will you?

Have you any water in the lakes now? Do you get the snows clearer? It has been raining all through this summer here. Wehad very few burning days, only a number of stuffy ones. Our rains also have nearly set in. In a week the deluge will commence in earnest.

As for me, I am much stronger than before; and when seven miles of jolting in a bullock-cart and railway travel of thirty-four miles did not bring back the dropsy to the feet, I am sure it is not going to return.

But anyway, it is the Math that suits me best just now.","With all love,VIVEKANANDA.",,372,3,0

<p>You have not the least cause to be anxious. I am getting on
anyhow and am quite strong. As to diet, I find I have to restrict
myself and not follow the prescription of my doctor to eat anything I
like. The pills continue, however. Will you ask the boys if they can
get ""Amalaki"" [<i>Emblic myrobalan</i>] fruits in the<!--'Volume 9 Page 188'-->

and puckery eaten raw; but make marmalade of whole [ones] &#8212; delicious.

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

You have not the least cause to be anxious. I am getting on anyhow and am quite strong.

No anxiety on the score of Marie Louise's1arrival in Calcutta. She has not yet made any noise.

Things go on the same. I am trying to go to Monghyr — a place near Calcutta and said to be very salubrious.

We will think of your coming to Baghbazar after Nivedita has fairly started; till then keep quiet and lay on food.
